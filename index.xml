      <description>User can migrate existing pre-provisioned volumes to another storage array by using the array migration feature.
NOTE: Currently only migration of standalone block volumes is supported.
Prerequisites This feature needs to be planned in a controlled host environment.
If the user have native multipathing, the user has to run multipath list commands on all nodes to ensure that there are no faulty paths on the host. If any faulty paths exist, the user has to flush the paths, and have a clean setup before migration is triggered using the following command:</description>

      <description>This section covers CSM for Resiliency&amp;rsquo;s design. The detail is sufficient that you should be able to understand what CSM for Resiliency is designed to do in various situations and how it works. CSM for Resiliency is deployed as a sidecar named podmon with a CSI driver in both the controller pods and node pods. These are referred to as controller-podmon and node-podmon respectively.
Generally controller-podmon and the driver controller pods are deployed using a Deployment.</description>

      <description>CSM for Resiliency is primarily designed to detect pod failures due to some kind of node failure or node communication failure. The diagram below shows the hardware environment that is assumed in the design.
A Kubernetes Control Plane is assumed to exist that provides the K8S API service used by CSM for Resiliency. There is an arbitrary number of worker nodes (two are shown in the diagram) that are connected to the Control Plane through a K8S Control Plane IP Network.</description>

      <description>Install Replication Walkthrough NOTE: These steps should not be used when installing using Dell CSM Operator.
Set up repctl tool Before you begin, make sure you have the repctl tool available.
You can download a pre-built repctl binary from our Releases page.
wget https://github.com/dell/csm-replication/releases/download/v1.7.1/repctl-linux-amd64 mv repctl-linux-amd64 repctl chmod +x repctl Alternately, if you want to build the binary yourself, you can follow these steps:
git clone -b v1.7.1 https://github.com/dell/csm-replication.git cd csm-replication/repctl make build Installation steps NOTE: The repctl commands only have to be run from one Kubernetes cluster.</description>

      <description>One of the goals of high availability is to eliminate single points of failure in a storage system. In Kubernetes, this can mean that a single PV represents multiple read/write enabled volumes on different arrays, located at reasonable distances with both the volumes in sync with each other. If one of the volumes goes down, there will still be another volume available for read and write. This kind of high availability can be achieved by using SRDF Metro replication mode, supported only by PowerMax arrays.</description>

      <description>The dell-csm-replicator supports monitoring of DellCSIReplicationGroup Custom Resources (CRs).
Each RG is polled at a pre-defined interval and for each RG, a gRPC call is made to the driver which returns the status of the protection group on the array.
If an RG doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any PVs associated with it, the driver will not receive any monitoring request for that RG.
This status can be obtained from the RG using a standard kubectl get call on the resource name:</description>

      <description>Enabling Replication In CSI PowerStore Container Storage Modules (CSM) Replication sidecar is a helper container that is installed alongside a CSI driver to facilitate replication functionality. Such CSI drivers must implement dell-csi-extensions calls.
CSI driver for Dell PowerStore supports necessary extension calls from dell-csi-extensions. To be able to provision replicated volumes you would need to do the steps described in the following sections.
Before Installation On Storage Array Be sure to configure replication between multiple PowerStore instances using instructions provided by PowerStore storage.</description>

      <description>Before installing the drivers, Dell CSI Operator tries to validate the Custom Resource being created. If some mandatory environment variables are missing or there is a type mismatch, then the Operator will report an error during the reconciliation attempts.
Because of this, the status of the Custom Resource will change to &amp;ldquo;Failed&amp;rdquo; and the error captured in the &amp;ldquo;ErrorMessage&amp;rdquo; field in the status.
For example - If the PowerMax driver was installed in the namespace test-powermax and has the name powermax, then run the command kubectl get csipowermax/powermax -n test-powermax -o yaml to get the Custom Resource details.</description>

      <description>The Dell CSI Drivers support Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) and deployment on clusters bootstrapped with Mirantis Kubernetes Engine (MKE).
The installation process for the drivers on such clusters remains the same as the installation process on regular Kubernetes clusters.
On MKE-based clusters, kubectl may not be installed by default, it is important that kubectl is installed prior to the installation of the driver.
The worker nodes on MKE-backed clusters may run any of the OS which we support with upstream clusters.</description>

      <description>In the repository, a simple test manifest exists that creates three different PersistentVolumeClaims using default ext4, xfs, and nfs storage classes and automatically mounts them to the pod.
It assumes that you&amp;rsquo;ve created the same basic three storage classes from samples/storageclass folder without changing their names. If you&amp;rsquo;ve created different storage classes please edit tests/simple/simple.yaml and change PersistentVolumeClaim definitions to point to correct storage classes.
Steps
To run this test, run the kubectl command from the root directory of the repository: kubectl create -f .</description>

      <description>In the repository, a simple test manifest exists that creates three different PersistentVolumeClaims using default ext4, xfs, and nfs storage classes and automatically mounts them to the pod.
It assumes that you&amp;rsquo;ve created the same basic three storage classes from samples/storageclass folder without changing their names. If you&amp;rsquo;ve created different storage classes please edit tests/simple/simple.yaml and change PersistentVolumeClaim definitions to point to correct storage classes.
Steps
To run this test, run the kubectl command from the root directory of the repository: kubectl create -f .</description>
