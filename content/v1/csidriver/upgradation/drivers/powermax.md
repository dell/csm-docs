Description: Upgrade PowerMax CSI driver
---

You can upgrade CSI Driver for Dell PowerMax using Helm or Dell CSI Operator.

## Update Driver from v2.2 to v2.3 using Helm

**Steps**
1. Run `git clone -b v2.3.0 https://github.com/dell/csi-powermax.git` to clone the git repository and get the v2.3 driver.
2. Update the values file as needed.
2. Run the `csi-install` script with the option _\-\-upgrade_ by running: `cd ../dell-csi-helm-installer && ./csi-install.sh --namespace powermax --values ./my-powermax-settings.yaml --upgrade`.

*NOTE:*
- If you are upgrading from a driver version that was installed using Helm v2, ensure that you install Helm3 before installing the driver.
- To update any installation parameter after the driver has been installed, change the `my-powermax-settings.yaml` file and run the install script with the option _\-\-upgrade_, for example: `./csi-install.sh --namespace powermax --values ./my-powermax-settings.yaml â€“upgrade`.

## Upgrade using Dell CSI Operator:
**Note:** Upgrading the Operator does not upgrade the CSI Driver.

1. Please upgrade the Dell CSI Operator by following [here](./../operator).
2. Once the operator is upgraded, to upgrade the driver, refer [here](./../../../installation/operator/#update-csi-drivers).
