## Roles


Role data is stored in the `common` Config Map.

### Steps to execute in the existing Authorization deployment

1. Save the role data by saving the `common` configMap to a file.

```bash
kubectl -n <authorization-namespace> get configMap common -o yaml > roles.yaml
```

### Steps to execute in the Authorization deployment to restore

1. Delete the existing `common` configMap.

```bash
kubectl -n <authorization-namespace> delete configMap common
```

2. Apply the file containing the backed-up role data.

```bash
kubectl apply -f roles.yaml
```

3. Restart the `proxy-server` deployment.

```bash
kubectl -n <authorization-namespace> rollout restart deploy/proxy-server
deployment.apps/proxy-server restarted
```

## Storage

Storage data is stored in the `karavi-storage-secret` Secret.

### Steps to execute in the existing Authorization deployment

1. Save the storage data by saving the `karavi-storage-secret` Secret to a file.

```bash

kubectl -n <authorization-namespace> get secret karavi-storage-secret -o yaml > storage.yaml
```

### Steps to execute in the Authorization deployment to restore

1. Delete the existing `karavi-storage-secret` secret.

```bash
kubectl -n <authorization-namespace> delete secret karavi-storage-secret
```

2. Apply the file containing the storage data created in step 1.

```bash
kubectl apply -f storage.yaml
```

3. Restart the `proxy-server` deployment.

```bash
kubectl -n <authorization-namespace> rollout restart deploy/proxy-server
deployment.apps/proxy-server restarted
```

## Tenants, Quota, and Volume ownership

Redis is used to store application data regarding [tenants, quota, and volume ownership](../../design#quota--volume-ownership) with the Storage Class specified in the `redis.storageClass` parameter in the values file, or with the default Storage Class if that parameter was not specified. 

The Persistent Volume for Redis is dynamically provisioned by this Storage Class with the `redis-primary-pv-claim` Persistent Volume Claim. See the example.

```bash
kubectl get persistentvolume
```
```
NAME                CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS     CLAIM                                      STORAGECLASS    REASON   AGE
k8s-ab74921ab9      8Gi        RWO            Delete           Bound      authorization/redis-primary-pv-claim       <storage-class>          112m
```

### Steps to execute in the existing Authorization deployment

1. Create a backup of this volume, typically via snapshot and/or replication, and create a Persistent Volume Claim using this backup by following the Storage Class's provisioner documentation.

### Steps to execute in the Authorization deployment to restore

1. Edit the `redis-primary` Deployment to use the Persistent Volume Claim associated with the backup by running:

```bash
kubectl -n <authorization-namespace> edit deploy/redis-primary
```

The Deployment has a volumes field that should look like this: 

```yaml
volumes:
- name: redis-primary-volume
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: redis-primary-pv-claim
```

Replace the value of `claimName` with the name of the Persisent Volume Claim associated with the backup. If the new Persisent Volume Claim name is `redis-backup`, you would edit the deployment to look like this:

```yaml
volumes:
- name: redis-primary-volume
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: redis-backup
```

Once saved, Redis will now use the backup volume.
