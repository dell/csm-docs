There are no fixed issues in this release.

### Known Issues

| Issue | Workaround |
|-------|------------|
| Slow volume attached/detach | If your Kubernetes 1.17 or 1.18 cluster has a lot of VolumeAttachment objects, the attach/detach operations will be very slow. This is a known issue and affects all CSI plugins. It is tracked here: CSI VolumeAttachment slows pod startup time. To get around this problem you can upgrade to latest Kubernetes/OpenShift patches, which contains a partial fix: 1.17.8+, 1.18.5+|
| Topology related node labels are not removed automatically.  | Currently, when the driver is uninstalled, topology related node labels are not getting removed automatically. There is an open issue in the Kubernetes to fix this. Until the fix is released you need to manually remove the node labels |
