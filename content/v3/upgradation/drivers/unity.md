---

You can upgrade the CSI Driver for Dell EMC Unity using Helm or Dell CSI Operator.

### Using Helm

**Note:** While upgrading the driver via helm, controllerCount variable in myvalues.yaml can be at most one less than the number of worker nodes.

Preparing myvalues.yaml is the same as explained in install section.

To upgrade the driver from csi-unity v1.4 to csi-unity 1.5 (across K8S 1.18, K8S 1.19, K8S 1.20).

1. Get the latest csi-unity 1.5 code from Github.
2. Create myvalues.yaml according to csi-unity 1.5 .
3. Delete the existing default storage classes of csi-unity 1.4 .
4. Clone the repository https://github.com/dell/csi-unity , copy the helm/csi-unity/values.yaml to the new location 
   csi-unity/dell-csi-helm-installer with name say myvalues.yaml, to customize settings for installation edit myvalues.yaml as per the requirements.
5. Navigate to common-helm-installer folder and execute the following command:
   `./csi-install.sh --namespace unity --values ./myvalues.yaml --upgrade`
6. If the value of 'createStorageClassesWithTopology' is set to "true" in myvalues.yaml , then 

   - Check the default storage classes, VolumeBindingMode should be 'WaitForFirstConsumer'.

**Note:** User has to re-create existing custom-storage classes (if any) according to latest (v1.5) format.

### Using Operator

**Note:** While upgrading the driver via operator, replicas count in sample CR yaml can be at most one less than the number of worker nodes.  

To upgrade the driver from csi-unity v1.4 to csi-unity v1.5 (OpenShift 4.6) :   

1. Clone operator version 1.3.0

2. Execute `bash scripts/install.sh --upgrade`
This command will install latest version of operator.

3. Furnish the sample CR yaml according to your environment. 

4. For upgrading the csi-unity driver execute the following command:

   `kubectl apply -f <furnished-cr.yaml>`
