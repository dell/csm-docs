  Dell Container Storage Modules (CSM) for Observability PowerMax Metrics
---

This section outlines the metrics collected by the Container Storage Modules (CSM) Observability module for PowerMax. The [Grafana reference dashboards](https://github.com/dell/karavi-observability/blob/main/grafana/dashboards/powermax) for PowerMax metrics can be uploaded to your Grafana instance.

## Prerequisites
-  Unisphere user credentials must have PERF_MONITOR permissions.
-  Ensure time synchronization for Kubernetes cluster and PowerMax Unisphere by using Network Time Protocol (NTP).

## I/O Performance Metrics

Storage system I/O performance metrics (IOPS, bandwidth, latency) are available by default and broken down by storage group and volume.

To disable these metrics, set the ```performanceMetricsEnabled``` field under ```karaviMetricsPowerMax``` to false in helm/values.yaml.

The following I/O performance metrics are available from the OpenTelemetry collector endpoint. Please see the [CSM for Observability](../../) for more information on deploying and configuring the OpenTelemetry collector.

## Storage Capacity Metrics

Provides visibility into the total, used, and available capacity for a storage class and associated underlying storage construct.

To disable these metrics, set the ```capacityMetricsEnabled``` field under ```karaviMetricsPowerMax``` to false in helm/values.yaml.

The following storage capacity metrics are available from the OpenTelemetry collector endpoint. Please see the [CSM for Observability](../../) for more information on deploying and configuring the OpenTelemetry collector.
