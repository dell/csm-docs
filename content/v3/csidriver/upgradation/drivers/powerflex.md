Description: Upgrade PowerFlex CSI driver
---

You can upgrade the CSI Driver for Dell PowerFlex using Helm or Dell CSI Operator.

## Update Driver from v2.2 to v2.3 using Helm 
**Steps**
1. Run `git clone -b v2.3.0 https://github.com/dell/csi-powerflex.git` to clone the git repository and get the v2.3.0 driver.
2. You need to create config.yaml with the configuration of your system.
   Check this section in installation documentation:  [Install the Driver](../../../installation/helm/powerflex#install-the-driver)
3. Update values file as needed.
4. Run the `csi-install` script with the option _\-\-upgrade_ by running: `cd ../dell-csi-helm-installer && ./csi-install.sh --namespace vxflexos --values ./myvalues.yaml --upgrade`.

*NOTE:*
- If you are upgrading from a driver version that was installed using Helm v2, ensure that you install Helm3 before installing the driver.
- To update any installation parameter after the driver has been installed, change the `myvalues.yaml` file and run the install script with the option _\-\-upgrade_, for example: `./csi-install.sh --namespace vxflexos --values ./myvalues.yaml --upgrade`.
- The logging configuration from v1.5 will not work in v2.1, since the log configuration parameters are now set in the values.yaml file located at helm/csi-vxflexos/values.yaml. Please set the logging configuration parameters in the values.yaml file.

## Upgrade using Dell CSI Operator:
**Note:** Upgrading the Operator does not upgrade the CSI Driver.

1. Please upgrade the Dell CSI Operator by following [here](./../operator).
2. Once the operator is upgraded, to upgrade the driver, refer [here](./../../../installation/operator/#update-csi-drivers).
