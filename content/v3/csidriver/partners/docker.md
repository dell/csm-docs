Description: "About Mirantis Kubernetes Engine"

The Dell CSI Drivers support Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) and deployment on clusters bootstrapped with Mirantis Kubernetes Engine (MKE).

The installation process for the drivers on such clusters remains the same as the installation process on regular Kubernetes clusters.

On MKE-based clusters, kubectl may not be installed by default, it is important that kubectl is installed prior to the installation of the driver.

The worker nodes on MKE-backed clusters may run any of the OS which we support with upstream clusters.
