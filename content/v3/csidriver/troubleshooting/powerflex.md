| Symptoms | Prevention, Resolution or Workaround |
|------------|--------------|
| The installation fails with the following error message: <br />```Node xxx does not have the SDC installed```| Install the PowerFlex SDC on listed nodes. The SDC must be installed on all the nodes that need to pull an image of the driver. |
| When you run the command `kubectl describe pods vxflexos-controller-* â€“n vxflexos`, the system indicates that the driver image could not be loaded. | - If on Kubernetes, edit the `daemon.json` file found in the registry location and add <br />```{ "insecure-registries" :[ "hostname.cloudapp.net:5000" ] }```<br />- If on OpenShift, run the command `oc edit image.config.openshift.io/cluster` and add registries to yaml file that is displayed when you run the command. |
|The `kubectl logs -n vxflexos vxflexos-controller-* driver` logs show that the driver is not authenticated.| Check the username, password, and the gateway IP address for the PowerFlex system.|
|The `kubectl logs vxflexos-controller-* -n vxflexos driver` logs show that the system ID is incorrect.| Use the `get_vxflexos_info.sh` to find the correct system ID. |
|The `kubectl logs vxflexos-controller-* -n vxflexos driver` logs show that the system ID is incorrect.| Use the `get_vxflexos_info.sh` to find the correct system ID. Add the system ID to `myvalues.yaml` script.|
|CreateVolume error System <Name> is not configured in the driver | Powerflex name if used for systemID in StorageClass ensure same name is also used in array config systemID |  
|Defcontext mount option seems to be ignored, volumes still are not being labeled correctly.|Ensure SElinux is enabled on a worker node, and ensure your container run time manager is properly configured to be utilized with SElinux.|
|Mount options that interact with SElinux are not working (like defcontext).|Check that your container orchestrator is properly configured to work with SElinux.|
|Installation of the driver on Kubernetes v1.25/v1.26/v1.27 fails with the following error: <br />```Error: unable to build kubernetes objects from release manifest: unable to recognize "": no matches for kind "VolumeSnapshotClass" in version "snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1"```|Kubernetes v1.23/v1.24/v1.25 requires v1 version of snapshot CRDs to be created in cluster, see the [Volume Snapshot Requirements](../../../deployment/helm/drivers/installation/powerflex/#optional-volume-snapshot-requirements)|
| The `kubectl logs -n vxflexos vxflexos-controller-* driver` logs show `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` |A self assigned certificate is used for PowerFlex array. See [certificate validation for PowerFlex Gateway](../../../deployment/helm/drivers/installation/powerflex/#certificate-validation-for-powerflex-gateway-rest-api-calls)|
| When you run the command `kubectl apply -f snapclass-v1.yaml`, you get the error `error: unable to recognize "snapclass-v1.yaml": no matches for kind "VolumeSnapshotClass" in version "snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1"` | Check to make sure that the v1 snapshotter CRDs are installed, and not the v1beta1 CRDs, which are no longer supported. |
| The controller pod is stuck and producing errors such as" `Failed to watch *v1.VolumeSnapshotContent: failed to list *v1.VolumeSnapshotContent: the server could not find the requested resource (get volumesnapshotcontents.snapshot.storage.k8s.io)` | Make sure that v1 snapshotter CRDs and v1 snapclass are installed, and not v1beta1, which is no longer supported. |
| Driver install or upgrade fails because of an incompatible Kubernetes version, even though the version seems to be within the range of compatibility. For example: `Error: UPGRADE FAILED: chart requires kubeVersion: >= 1.21.0 <= 1.28.0 which is incompatible with Kubernetes V1.21.11-mirantis-1` | If you are using an extended Kubernetes version, see the helm Chart at `helm/csi-vxflexos/Chart.yaml` and use the alternate `kubeVersion` check that is provided in the comments. Note: this is not meant to be used to enable the use of pre-release alpha and beta versions, which is not supported. |
| Volume metrics are missing | Enable [Volume Health Monitoring](../../features/powerflex#volume-health-monitoring) |
| When a node goes down, the block volumes attached to the node cannot be attached to another node                                           | This is a known issue and has been reported at https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-attacher/issues/215. Workaround: <br /> 1. Force delete the pod running on the node that went down <br /> 2. Delete the volumeattachment to the node that went down. <br /> Now the volume can be attached to the new node.                   |
| CSI-PowerFlex volumes cannot mount; are being recognized as multipath devices | CSI-PowerFlex does not support multipath; to fix: <br/> 1. Remove any multipath mapping involving a powerflex volume with `multipath -f <powerflex volume>` <br/> 2. Blacklist CSI-PowerFlex volumes in multipath config file |
 | When attempting a driver upgrade, you see: ```spec.fsGroupPolicy: Invalid value: "xxx": field is immutable``` |  You cannot upgrade between drivers with different fsGroupPolicies. See [upgrade documentation](../../../deployment/helm/drivers/upgrade/powerflex) for more details | 
 | When accessing ROX mode PVC in OpenShift where the worker nodes are non-root user, you see: ```Permission denied``` while accesing the PVC mount location from the pod. | Set the ```securityContext``` for ROX mode PVC pod as below, as it defines privileges for the pods or containers.<br/><br/>securityContext:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;runAsUser: 0<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;runAsGroup: 0 |
| After installing version v2.6.0 of the driver using the default `powerflexSdc` image, sdc:3.6.0.6, the vxflexos-node pods are in an `Init:CrashLoopBackOff` state. This issue can happen on hosts that require the SDC to be installed manually. Automatic SDC is only supported on Red Hat CoreOS (RHCOS), RHEL 7.9, RHEL 8.4, RHEL 8.6. | The SDC is already installed. Change the `images.powerflexSdc` value to an empty value in the [values](https://github.com/dell/csi-powerflex/blob/72b27acee7553006cc09df97f85405f58478d2e4/helm/csi-vxflexos/values.yaml#L13) and re-install. |
| After installing version v2.8.0 of the driver using the default `powerflexSdc` image, sdc:3.6.1, the vxflexos-node pods are in an `Init:CrashLoopBackOff` state. This issue can happen on hosts that require the SDC to be installed manually. Automatic SDC is only supported on Red Hat CoreOS (RHCOS), RHEL 7.9, RHEL 8.4, RHEL 8.6. | The SDC is already installed. Change the `images.powerflexSdc` value to an empty value in the [values](https://github.com/dell/csi-powerflex/blob/72b27acee7553006cc09df97f85405f58478d2e4/helm/csi-vxflexos/values.yaml#L13) and re-install. |
| In version v2.6.0, the driver is crashing because the External Health Monitor sidecar crashes when a persistent volume is not found. | This is a known issue reported at [kubernetes-csi/external-health-monitor#100](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-health-monitor/issues/100). |
| In version v2.6.0, when a cluster node goes down, the block volumes attached to the node cannot be attached to another node. | This is a known issue reported at [kubernetes-csi/external-attacher#215](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-attacher/issues/215). Workaround: <br/> 1. Force delete the pod running on the node that went down. <br/> 2. Delete the pod's persistent volume attachment on the node that went down. Now the volume can be attached to the new node.
A CSI ephemeral pod may not get created in OpenShift 4.13 and fail with the error `"error when creating pod: the pod uses an inline volume provided by CSIDriver csi-vxflexos.dellemc.com, and the namespace has a pod security enforcement level that is lower than privileged."` | This issue occurs because OpenShift 4.13 introduced the CSI Volume Admission plugin to restrict the use of a CSI driver capable of provisioning CSI ephemeral volumes during pod admission. Therefore, an additional label `security.openshift.io/csi-ephemeral-volume-profile` in [csidriver.yaml](https://github.com/dell/helm-charts/blob/csi-vxflexos-2.8.0/charts/csi-vxflexos/templates/csidriver.yaml) file with the required security profile value should be provided. Follow [OpenShift 4.13 documentation for CSI Ephemeral Volumes](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/storage/container_storage_interface/ephemeral-storage-csi-inline.html) for more information. |
