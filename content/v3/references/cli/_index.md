  CLI for Dell Container Storage Modules (CSM)
---
dellctl is a common command line interface(CLI) used to interact with and manage your [Container Storage Modules](https://github.com/dell/csm) (CSM) resources.
This document outlines all dellctl commands, their intended use, options that can be provided to alter their execution, and expected output from those commands.

| Command | Description |
| - | - |
| [dellctl](#dellctl) | dellctl is used to interact with Container Storage Modules |
| [dellctl cluster](#dellctl-cluster) | Manipulate one or more k8s cluster configurations |
| [dellctl cluster add](#dellctl-cluster-add) | Add a k8s cluster to be managed by dellctl |
| [dellctl cluster remove](#dellctl-cluster-remove) | Removes a k8s cluster managed by dellctl |
| [dellctl cluster get](#dellctl-cluster-get) | List all clusters currently being managed by dellctl |
| [dellctl backup](#dellctl-backup) | Allows to manipulate application backups/clones |
| [dellctl backup create](#dellctl-backup-create) | Create an application backup/clones |
| [dellctl backup delete](#dellctl-backup-delete) | Delete application backups |

## Installation instructions
1. Download `dellctl` from [here](https://github.com/dell/csm/releases/tag/v1.4.0).
2. chmod +x dellctl
3. Move `dellctl` to `/usr/local/bin` or add `dellctl`'s containing directory path to PATH environment variable.
4. Run `dellctl --help` to know available commands or run `dellctl command --help` to know more about a specific command.

By default, the `dellctl` runs against local cluster(referenced by `KUBECONFIG` environment variable or by a kube config file present at default location).
The user can register one or more remote clusters for `dellctl`, and run any `dellctl` command against these clusters by specifying the registered cluster id to the command.
