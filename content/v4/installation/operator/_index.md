  Installation of Dell EMC CSI drivers using Dell CSI Operator
---

The Dell CSI Operator is a Kubernetes Operator, which can be used to install and manage the CSI Drivers provided by Dell EMC for various storage platforms. This operator is available as a community operator for upstream Kubernetes and can be deployed using OperatorHub.io. It is also available as a certified operator for OpenShift clusters and can be deployed using OpenShift Container Platform. Both these methods of installation use OLM (Operator Lifecycle Manager).  The operator can also be deployed manually.

- For installing via OperatorHub.io on Kubernetes, go to the [OperatorHub page](../../partners/operator/).
