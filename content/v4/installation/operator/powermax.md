## Installing PowerMax CSI Driver via Operator

The CSI Driver for Dell EMC PowerMax can be installed via the Dell CSI Operator.

To deploy the Operator, follow the instructions available [here](../).

There are sample manifests provided which can be edited to do an easy installation of the driver. Please note that the deployment of the driver using the operator does not use any Helm charts and the installation and configuration parameters will be slightly different from the ones specified via the Helm installer.

Kubernetes Operators make it easy to deploy and manage entire lifecycle of complex Kubernetes applications. Operators use Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) which represents the application and use custom controllers to manage them.

### Prerequisite

#### Create secret for client-side TLS verification (Optional)
Create a secret named powermax-certs in the namespace where the CSI PowerMax driver will be installed. This is an optional step and is only required if you are setting the env variable X_CSI_POWERMAX_SKIP_CERTIFICATE_VALIDATION to false. Please refer detailed documentation on how to create this secret [here](../../helm/powermax#certificate-validation-for-unisphere-rest-api-calls).


### Install Driver

1. Create namespace:
   Run `kubectl create namespace <driver-namespace>` using the desired name to create the namespace.
2. Create PowerMax credentials:
   Create a file called powermax-creds.yaml with the following content
     ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
	      kind: Secret
	      metadata:
          name: powermax-creds
	        # Replace driver-namespace with the namespace where driver is being deployed
	        namespace: <driver-namespace>
	      type: Opaque
	      data:
	        # set username to the base64 encoded username
	        username: <base64 username>
	        # set password to the base64 encoded password
	        password: <base64 password>
          # Uncomment the following key if you wish to use ISCSI CHAP authentication (v1.3.0 onwards)
          # chapsecret: <base64 CHAP secret>
     ```
   Replace the values for the username and password parameters. These values can be obtained using base64 encoding as described in the following example:
   ```
   echo -n "myusername" | base64
   echo -n "mypassword" | base64
   # If mychapsecret is the ISCSI CHAP secret
   echo -n "mychapsecret" | base64

   ```
   Run `kubectl create -f powermax-creds.yaml` command to create the secret.
3. Create a Custom Resource (CR) for PowerMax using the sample files provided [here](https://github.com/dell/dell-csi-operator/tree/master/samples). 
4. Users should configure the parameters in CR. The following table lists the primary configurable parameters of the PowerMax driver and their default values:
   
   | Parameter | Description | Required | Default |
   | --------- | ----------- | -------- |-------- |
   | replicas | Controls the amount of controller Pods you deploy. If controller Pods are greater than number of available nodes, excess Pods will become stuck in pending. Defaults is 2 which allows for Controller high availability. | Yes | 2 |
   | ***Common parameters for node and controller*** |
   | X_CSI_K8S_CLUSTER_PREFIX | Define a prefix that is appended onto all resources created in the array; unique per K8s/CSI deployment; max length - 3 characters | Yes | XYZ |
   | X_CSI_POWERMAX_ENDPOINT | IP address of the Unisphere for PowerMax | Yes | https://0.0.0.0:8443 |
   | X_CSI_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL | Choose what transport protocol to use (ISCSI, FC, auto or None)	| Yes | auto |
   | X_CSI_POWERMAX_PORTGROUPS |List of comma-separated port groups (ISCSI only). Example: "PortGroup1,PortGroup2" | No | - | 
   | X_CSI_POWERMAX_ARRAYS | List of comma-separated array id(s) which will be managed by the driver | No | - |
   | X_CSI_POWERMAX_PROXY_SERVICE_NAME | Name of CSI PowerMax ReverseProxy service. Leave blank if not using reverse proxy | No | - |
   | X_CSI_GRPC_MAX_THREADS | Number of concurrent grpc requests allowed per client | No | 4 |
   | X_CSI_POWERMAX_DRIVER_NAME | Set custom CSI driver name. For more details on this feature review related [documentation](../../../features/powermax/#custom-driver-name-experimental-feature) | No | - |
   | X_CSI_IG_NODENAME_TEMPLATE | Template used for creating hosts on PowerMax. Example: "a-b-c-%foo%-xyz" where the text between the % symbols(foo) is replaced by the actual host name | No | - |
   | X_CSI_IG_MODIFY_HOSTNAME | Determines if node plugin can rename any existing host on the PowerMax array. Use it with the node name template to rename the existing hosts | No | false 
   | X_CSI_POWERMAX_DEBUG | Determines if HTTP Request/Response is logged | No | false |
   | ***Node parameters***|
   | X_CSI_POWERMAX_ISCSI_ENABLE_CHAP | Enable ISCSI CHAP authentication. For more details on this feature review the related [documentation](../../../features/powermax/#iscsi-chap) | No | false |
   | ***StorageClass parameters***|
   | SYMID | Symmetrix ID | Yes | 000000000001 |
   | SRP | Storage Resource Pool Name | Yes | DEFAULT_SRP |
   | ServiceLevel | Service Level | No | Bronze |
   | FsType | File System type (xfs/ext4) | xfs |
   | allowVolumeExpansion | After the allowed topology is modified in storage class, pods/and volumes will always be scheduled on nodes that have access to the storage | No | false |
   | allowedTopologies:key | This is to enable topology to allow pods/and volumes to always be scheduled on nodes that have access to the storage. You need to specify the PowerMax array ID and append .fc or .iscsi at the end of it to specify a protocol. For more details on this feature review the related [documentation](../../../features/powermax#topology-support) | No | "000000000001" | 
5.  Execute the following command to create PowerMax custom resource:`kubectl create -f <input_sample_file.yaml>`. The above command will deploy the CSI-PowerMax driver.

### CSI PowerMax ReverseProxy

CSI PowerMax ReverseProxy is an optional component which can be installed along with the CSI PowerMax driver. For more details on this feature review the related [documentation](../../../features/powermax#csi-powermax-reverse-proxy).

When you install CSI PowerMax ReverseProxy, dell-csi-operator is going to create a Deployment and ClusterIP service as part of the installation

**Note** - If you wish to use the ReverseProxy with CSI PowerMax driver, the ReverseProxy service should be created before you install the CSIPowerMax driver.

#### Pre-requisites
Create a TLS secret which holds a SSL certificate and a private key which is required by the reverse proxy server. 
Use a tool like `openssl` to generate this secret using the example below:

```
    openssl genrsa -out tls.key 2048
    openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key tls.key -out tls.crt -days 3650
    kubectl create secret -n powermax tls revproxy-certs --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key
```

#### Set the following parameters in the CSI PowerMaxReverseProxy Spec
**tlsSecret** : Provide the name of the TLS secret. If using the above example, it should be set to `revproxy-certs`  
**config** : This section contains the details of the Reverse Proxy configuration  
**mode** : This value is set to `Linked` by default. Do not change this value  
**linkConfig** : This section contains the configuration of the `Linked` mode  
**primary** : This section holds details for the primary Unisphere which the Reverse Proxy will connect to
**backup** : This optional section holds details for a backup Unisphere which the Reverse Proxy can connect to if Primary Unisphere is unreachable  
**url** : URL of the Unisphere server
**skipCertificateValidation**: This setting determines if the client-side Unisphere certificate validation is required
**certSecret**: Secret name which holds the CA certificates which was used to sign Unisphere SSL certificates. Mandatory if skipCertificateValidation is set to `false`

Here is a sample manifest with each field annotated. A copy of this manifest is provided in the `samples` folder
```
apiVersion: storage.dell.com/v1
kind: CSIPowerMaxRevProxy
metadata:
  name: powermax-reverseproxy # <- Name of the CSIPowerMaxRevProxy object
  namespace: test-powermax # <- Set the namespace to where you will install the CSI PowerMax driver
spec:
  # Image for CSI PowerMax ReverseProxy
  image: dellemc/csipowermax-reverseproxy:v1.0.0.000R # <- CSI PowerMax Reverse Proxy image 
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  # TLS secret which contains SSL certificate and private key for the Reverse Proxy server
  tlsSecret: csirevproxy-tls-secret
  config:
    # Mode for the proxy - only supported mode for now is "Linked"
    mode: Linked
    linkConfig:
      primary:
        url: https://0.0.0.0:8443 #Unisphere URL
        skipCertificateValidation: true # This setting determines if client side Unisphere certificate validation is to be skipped
        certSecret: "" # Provide this value if skipCertificateValidation is set to false
      backup: # This is an optional field and lets you configure a backup unisphere which can be used by proxy server
        url: https://0.0.0.0:8443 #Unisphere URL
        skipCertificateValidation: true
```

#### Installation
Copy the sample file - `powermax_reverseproxy.yaml` from the `samples` folder or use the sample available in the `OperatorHub` UI  
Edit and input all required parameters and then use the `OperatorHub` UI or run the following command to install the CSI PowerMax Reverse Proxy service

    kubectl create -f powermax_reverseproxy.yaml

You can query for the deployment and service created as part of the installation using the following commands:
  
    kubectl get deployment -n <namespace>
    kubectl get svc -n <namespace>
