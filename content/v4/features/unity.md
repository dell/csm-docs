## Creating volumes and consuming them

Create a file `simple.yaml` using sample yaml files located at tests/sample.yaml

This command will create a statefulset that consumes three volumes of default storage classes

```bash
kubectl create -f tests/sample.yaml
```

After executing this command 3 PVC and statefulset will be created in the `test-unity` namespace.
You can check created PVCs by running `kubectl get pvc -n test-unity` and check statefulset's pods by running `kubectl get pods -n test-unity`command.
Pod should be `Ready` and `Running`.

> If Pod is in CrashLoopback or PVCs is in Pending state then driver installation is not successful, check logs of node and controller.

## Deleting volumes

To delete volumes, pod and statefulset run the command

```bash
kubectl delete -f tests/sample.yaml
```

## Consuming existing volumes with static provisioning

You can use existent volumes from Unity array as Persistent Volumes in your Kubernetes, to do that you must perform the following steps:

1. Open your volume in Unity Management UI (unisphere), and take a note of volume-id. The `volume-id` looks like `csiunity-xxxxx` and CLI ID looks like `sv_xxxx`.
2. Create PersistentVolume and use this volume-id as a volumeHandle in the manifest. Modify other parameters according to your needs.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
    name: static-1
    annotations:
       pv.kubernetes.io/provisioned-by: csi-unity.dellemc.com
spec:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    capacity:
        storage: 5Gi
    csi:
        driver: csi-unity.dellemc.com
        volumeHandle: existingvol-<protocol>-<array_id>-<volume-id>
    persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
    claimRef:
      namespace: default
      name: static-pvc1
    storageClassName: unity
    volumeMode: Filesystem
```

3. Create PersistentVolumeClaim to use this PersistentVolume.

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim                
apiVersion: v1                             
metadata:                                  
  name: static-pvc1                        
spec:                                      
  accessModes:                             
    - ReadWriteMany                        
  resources:                               
    requests:                              
      storage: 5Gi                         
  volumeName: static-1                     
  storageClassName: unity            
```

4. Then use this PVC as a volume in a pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: static-prov-pod
spec:
    containers:
      - name: test
        image: docker.io/centos:latest
        command: [ "/bin/sleep", "3600" ]
        volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: "/data0"
            name: pvol
    volumes:
      - name: pvol
        persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: static-pvc1
```

5. After the pod becomes `Ready` and `Running`, you can start to use this pod and volume.

## Volume Snapshot Feature

The CSI Unity driver version 1.4 and later supports managing beta snapshots. 

To use Volume Snapshots, ensure the following components have been deployed to your cluster:

- Kubernetes Volume Snaphshot CRDs
- Volume Snapshot Controller

You can install them by copy pasting the following commands (Copy entire thing in one shot and paste it in terminal): 

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter/release-2.0/config/crd/snapshot.storage.k8s.io_volumesnapshotclasses.yaml &&
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter/release-2.0/config/crd/snapshot.storage.k8s.io_volumesnapshotcontents.yaml &&
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter/release-2.0/config/crd/snapshot.storage.k8s.io_volumesnapshots.yaml &&
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter/v3.0.2/deploy/kubernetes/snapshot-controller/rbac-snapshot-controller.yaml &&
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter/v3.0.2/deploy/kubernetes/snapshot-controller/setup-snapshot-controller.yaml   
```

> For general use, update the snapshot controller YAMLs with an appropriate namespace before installing. For
> example, on a Vanilla Kubernetes cluster, update the namespace from default to kube-system before issuing the
> kubectl create command.

### Volume Snapshot Class

During the installation of the CSI Unity driver version 1.3 and later, a Volume Snapshot Class is created using the new v1beta1 snapshot APIs. This is the only Volume Snapshot Class required and there is no need to create any other Volume Snapshot Class.

Following is the manifest for the Volume Snapshot Class created during installation:

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
  name: unity-snapclass
driver: csi-unity.dellemc.com
deletionPolicy: Delete
```

### Create Volume Snapshot

The following is a sample manifest for creating a Volume Snapshot using the **v1beta1** snapshot APIs:

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  name: pvol0-snap
  namespace: test-unity
spec:
  volumeSnapshotClassName: unity-snapclass
  source:
    persistentVolumeClaimName: pvol
```

Once the VolumeSnapshot is successfully created by the CSI Unity driver, a VolumeSnapshotContent object is automatically created. Once the status of the VolumeSnapshot object has the _readyToUse_ field set to _true_ , it is available for use.

Following is the relevant section of VolumeSnapshot object status:

```yaml
status:
  boundVolumeSnapshotContentName: snapcontent-xxxxxxxxxxxxx
  creationTime: "2020-07-16T08:42:12Z"
  readyToUse: true
```

### Creating PVCs with Volume Snapshots as Source

The following is a sample manifest for creating a PVC with a VolumeSnapshot as a source:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: restorepvc
  namespace: test-unity
spec:
  storageClassName: unity-iscsi
  dataSource:
    name: pvol0-snap
    kind: VolumeSnapshot
    apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi
```

## Volume Expansion

The CSI Unity driver version 1.3 and later supports the expansion of Persistent Volumes (PVs). This expansion can be done either online (for example, when a PVC is attached to a node) or offline (for example, when a PVC is not attached to any node).

To use this feature, the storage class that is used to create the PVC must have the attribute `allowVolumeExpansion` set to true. The storage classes created during the installation (both using Helm or dell-csi-operator) have the `allowVolumeExpansion` set to true by default.

If you are creating more storage classes, ensure that this attribute is set to true to expand any PVs created using these new storage classes.

The following is a sample manifest for a storage class which allows for Volume Expansion:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
    name: unity-expand-sc
    annotations:
        storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: false
provisioner: csi-unity.dellemc.com
reclaimPolicy: Delete
allowVolumeExpansion: true # Set this attribute to true if you plan to expand any PVCs created using this storage class
parameters:
    FsType: xfs
```

To resize a PVC, edit the existing PVC spec and set spec.resources.requests.storage to the intended size. For example, if you have a PVC unity-pvc-demo of size 3Gi, then you can resize it to 30Gi by updating the PVC.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
    name: unity-pvc-demo
    namespace: test
spec:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    volumeMode: Filesystem
    resources:
        requests:
            storage: 30Gi # Updated size from 3Gi to 30Gi
    storageClassName: unity-expand-sc
```

>The Kubernetes Volume Expansion feature can only be used to increase the size of a volume. It cannot be used to shrink a volume.

## Raw block support

The CSI Unity driver version 1.3 and later supports managing Raw Block volumes.

Raw Block volumes are created using the volumeDevices list in the pod template spec with each entry accessing a
`volumeClaimTemplate` specifying a `volumeMode: Block`. An example configuration is outlined here:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
    name: unitytest
    namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
spec:
    ...
        spec:
            ...
            containers:
              - name: test
                ...
                volumeDevices:
                  - devicePath: "/dev/data0"
                    name: pvol
    volumeClaimTemplates:
      - metadata:
            name: pvol
        spec:
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
        volumeMode: Block
        storageClassName: unity
        resources:
            requests:
                storage: 8Gi
```

Allowable access modes are `ReadWriteOnce`, `ReadWriteMany`, and for block devices that have been previously initialized,
`ReadOnlyMany`.

Raw Block volumes are presented as a block device to the pod by using a bind mount to a block device in the node's file system.
The driver does not format or check the format of any file system on the block device. Raw Block volumes do support online
Volume Expansion, but it is up to the application to manage reconfiguring the file system (if any) to the new size.

Note: Raw block volume creation supports only for **FC** and **iSCSI** protocols

For additional information, see the [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/DOCS/CONCEPTS/STORAGE/PERSISTENT-VOLUMES/#RAW-BLOCK-VOLUME-SUPPORT) website.


## Volume Cloning Feature

The CSI Unity driver version 1.3 supports volume cloning. This allows specifying existing PVCs in the _dataSource_ field to indicate a user would like to clone a Volume.

Source and destination PVC must be in the same namespace and have the same Storage Class.

To clone a volume, you should first have an existing PVC, example: vol0:

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: vol0
  namespace: test-unity
spec:
  storageClassName: unity-nfs
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi
```

The following is a sample manifest for cloning pvol0:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: cloned-pvc
  namespace: test-unity
spec:
  storageClassName: unity-nfs
  dataSource:
    name: vol0
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi
```

## Ephemeral Inline Volume

The CSI Unity driver version 1.4 supports ephemeral inline CSI volumes. This feature allows CSI volumes to be specified directly in the pod specification. 

At runtime, nested inline volumes follow the ephemeral lifecycle of their associated pods where the driver handles all phases of volume operations as pods are created and destroyed.

The following is a sample manifest for creating ephemeral volume in pod manifest with CSI Unity driver.

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: test-unity-ephemeral-volume
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test-container
      image: busybox
      command: [ "sleep", "3600" ]
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/data"
        name: volume
  volumes:
  - name: volume
    csi:
      driver: csi-unity.dellemc.com
      fsType: "ext4"
      volumeAttributes:
        size: "10Gi"
```

This manifest will create a pod and attach newly created ephemeral inline CSI volume to it. 

To create `NFS` volume you need to provide `nasName:` parameters that points to the name of your NAS Server in pod manifest like so

```yaml
  volumes:
  - name: volume
    csi:
      driver: csi-unity.dellemc.com
      fsType: "nfs"
      volumeAttributes:
        size: "20Gi"
        nasName: "csi-nas-name"
```

## Controller HA

The CSI Unity driver version 1.4 introduces controller HA feature. Instead of StatefulSet controller pods deployed as a Deployment.

By default number of replicas set to 2, you can set `controllerCount` parameter to 1 in `myvalues.yaml` if you want to disable controller HA for your installation. When installing via Operator you can change `replicas` parameter in `spec.driver` section in your Unity Custom Resource.

When multiple replicas of controller pods are in cluster each sidecar (Attacher, Provisioner, Resizer and Snapshotter) tries to get a lease so only one instance of each sidecar would be active in the cluster at a time. 

### Driver pod placement

You can configure where driver controller and worker pods should be placed. 
To do that you will need to use `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` mechanisms you can configure in your `myvalues.yaml`

For example you can specify `tolerations` to assign driver controller pods on controller nodes too:

```yaml
# "controller" allows to configure controller specific parameters
controller:
  # "controller.nodeSelector" defines what nodes would be selected for pods of controller deployment
  nodeSelector:

# "controller.tolerations" defines tolerations that would be applied to controller deployment
  tolerations:
   - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/master"
     operator: "Exists"
     effect: "NoSchedule"
```

If you want to assign controller pods ONLY on controller nodes you need to configure `nodeSelector`:

```yaml
# "controller" allows to configure controller specific parameters
controller:
  # "controller.nodeSelector" defines what nodes would be selected for pods of controller deployment
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/master: ""

  # "controller.tolerations" defines tolerations that would be applied to controller deployment
  tolerations:
   - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/master"
     operator: "Exists"
     effect: "NoSchedule"
```

As said before you can configure where node driver pods would be assigned in the similar way in `node` section of `myvalues.yaml`

## Topology

The CSI Unity driver version 1.4 supports Topology which forces volumes to be placed on worker nodes that have connectivity to the backend storage. This covers use cases where users have chosen to restrict the nodes on which the CSI driver is deployed.

This Topology support does not include customer defined topology, users cannot create their own labels for nodes, they should use whatever labels are returned by driver and applied automatically by Kubernetes on its nodes.

### Topology Usage

To use the Topology feature user can install driver by setting `createStorageClassesWithTopology` to true in the `myvalues.yaml` which will create default storage classes by adding topology keys (based on the arrays specified in `myvalues.yaml`) and with `WaitForFirstConsumer` binding mode. 

Another option is the user can create custom storage classes on their own by specifying the valid topology keys and binding mode.

The following is one of example storage class manifest: 

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: unity-topology-fc
provisioner: csi-unity.dellemc.com
reclaimPolicy: Delete
allowVolumeExpansion: true
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
allowedTopologies:
  - matchLabelExpressions:
      - key: csi-unity.dellemc.com/<array_id>-fc
        values:
          - "true"
```

This example will match all nodes where driver has a connection to Unity array with array ID mentioned via Fiber Channel. Similarly by replacing `fc` with `iscsi` in the key will check for iSCSI connectivity with the node.

You can check what labels your nodes contain by running `kubectl get nodes --show-labels` command.

>Note that `volumeBindingMode:` is set to `WaitForFirstConsumer` this is required for topology feature to work properly.

For any additional information about topology, see the [Kubernetes Topology documentation](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/topology.html).
