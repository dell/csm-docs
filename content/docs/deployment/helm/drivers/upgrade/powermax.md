Upgrades to the CSI Driver for Dell PowerMax can be made using Helm or Dell CSM Operator.

**Note:** CSI Driver for PowerMax v2.4.0 and later requires Unisphere version 10.0, or later, in order to support REST APIs.

### Updating the CSI Driver to use 10.0 Unisphere

1. Upgrade the Unisphere to have 10.0 endpoint support. Please find the instructions [here.](https://dl.dell.com/content/manual34878027-dell-unisphere-for-powermax-10-0-0-installation-guide.pdf?language=en-us&ps=true)
2. Update the powermax reverse proxy secret to specify endpoints with Unisphere version 10.0 support.

## Update Driver from v2.13.0 to v2.14.0 using Helm

**Steps**

1. Run `git clone -b v2.14.0 https://github.com/dell/csi-powermax.git` to clone the git repository.
2. As of CSI PowerMax v2.14.0, the csi reverse proxy configuration and connectivity information has been migrated from a ConfigMap to a Secret. If a powermax reverse proxy secret was not previously created, reference [helm install instructions step 3](../../installation/powermax#installation) and your existing `my-powermax-settings.yaml` file to configure the new powermax reverseproxy Secret. Then create the `powermax-reverseproxy-secret` Secret.
   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic powermax-reverseproxy-secret --namespace powermax --from-file=config=samples/secret/secret.yaml
   ```
> Note: The ConfigMap has been deprecated as of CSI PowerMax v2.14.0 and will be removed in a future release. The `powermax-reverseproxy-config` remains for backward compatibility only. Use of the powermax reverse proxy secret is recommended.
3. Download the latest helm values file and update as needed, making sure to update `csireverseproxy.secretName` to match the name of the Secret created above.
   ```bash
   wget -O my-powermax-settings.yaml https://github.com/dell/helm-charts/raw/csi-powermax-2.14.0/charts/csi-powermax/values.yaml
   ```
4. Run the `csi-install` script with the option _\-\-upgrade_ by running:
   ```bash
   cd ../dell-csi-helm-installer && ./csi-install.sh --namespace powermax --values ./my-powermax-settings.yaml --upgrade --helm-charts-version <version>
   ```

> Notes:
> - The parameter `--helm-charts-version` is optional and if you do not specify the flag, by default the `csi-install.sh` script will clone the version of the helm chart that is specified in the driver's [csi-install.sh](https://github.com/dell/csi-powermax/blob/main/dell-csi-helm-installer/csi-install.sh#L52) file. If you wish to install the driver using a different version of the helm chart, you need to include this flag. Also, remember to delete the `helm-charts` repository present in the `csi-powermax` directory if it was cloned before.
> - If you are upgrading from a driver version that was installed using Helm v2, ensure that you install Helm3 before installing the driver.
> - To update any installation parameter after the driver has been installed, change the `my-powermax-settings.yaml` file and run the install script with the option _\-\-upgrade_, for example:
>   ```bash
>   ./csi-install.sh --namespace powermax --values ./my-powermax-settings.yaml â€“upgrade
>   ```
> - You cannot upgrade between drivers with different fsGroupPolicies. To check the current driver's fsGroupPolicy, use this command:
>   ```bash
>   kubectl describe csidriver csi-powermax
>   ```
>   and check the "Spec" section:
>
>    ```yaml
>    ...
>    Spec:
>      Attach Required:     true
>      Fs Group Policy:     ReadWriteOnceWithFSType
>      Pod Info On Mount:   false
>      Requires Republish:  false
>      Storage Capacity:    false
>    ...
>
>    ```

## Upgrade using Dell CSM Operator

**Note:** Upgrading the Operator does not upgrade the CSI Driver.

1. Upgrade the Dell CSM Operator by following [here](../../../../../deployment/csmoperator/#to-upgrade-dell-csm-operator-perform-the-following-steps)
2. Once the operator is upgraded, to upgrade the driver, refer [here](../../../../../deployment/csmoperator/#upgrade-driver-using-dell-csm-operator)
