The CSI Driver for Dell PowerMax can be deployed by using the provided Helm v3 charts and installation scripts on both Kubernetes and OpenShift platforms. For more detailed information on the installation scripts, see the script [documentation](https://github.com/dell/csi-powermax/tree/master/dell-csi-helm-installer).

## Prerequisites

The following requirements must be met before installing the CSI Driver for Dell PowerMax:

- A Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster (see [supported versions](../../../../../csidriver/#features-and-capabilities))
- Helm 3
- If enabling CSM for Authorization, please refer to the [Authorization deployment steps](../../../../../deployment/helm/modules/installation/authorization-v2.0/) first
- If enabling CSM Replication, both source and target storage systems must be locally managed by Unisphere.
  - _Example_: When using two Unisphere instances, the first Unisphere instance should be configured with the source storage system as locally
  managed and target storage system as remotely managed. The second Unisphere configuration should mirror the first — locally managing the target storage system and
  remotely managing the source storage system.
- Refer to the sections below for protocol specific requirements.
- For NVMe support the preferred multipath solution is NVMe native multipathing. The [Dell Host Connectivity Guide](https://elabnavigator.dell.com/vault/pdf/Linux.pdf) describes the details of each configuration option.
- Linux multipathing requirements (described later).
- PowerPath for Linux requirements (described later).
- Mount propagation is enabled on the container runtime that is being used.
- If using Snapshot feature, satisfy all Volume Snapshot requirements.
- Insecure registries are defined in Docker or other container runtimes for CSI drivers that are hosted in a non-secure location.
- Ensure that your nodes support mounting NFS volumes if using NFS.
- Auto RDM for vSphere over FC requirements

### CSI PowerMax Reverse Proxy

The CSI PowerMax Reverse Proxy is an HTTPS server and has to be configured with an SSL certificate and a private key.

The certificate and key are provided to the proxy via a Kubernetes TLS secret (in the same namespace). The SSL certificate must be an X.509 certificate encoded in PEM format. The certificates can be obtained via a Certificate Authority or can be self-signed and generated by a tool such as openssl.

Starting from v2.7.0 these secrets will be automatically created using the tls.key and tls.cert contents provided in my-powermax-settings.yaml file. For this to be used, we need to install cert-manager which manages the certs and secrets. Install cer-manager using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.11.0/cert-manager.yaml
```

The following example shows how to generate a private key and how to use that key to sign an SSL certificate using the openssl tool:

Create the Configuration file (openssl.cnf) which includes the subjectAltName:
```bash
[ req ]
default_bits       = 2048
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions     = req_ext
prompt             = no

[ req_distinguished_name ]
C  = XX
L  = Default City
O  = Default Company Ltd

[ req_ext ]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[ alt_names ]
DNS.1 = "powermax-reverseproxy"
IP.1 = "0.0.0.0"
```

Generate the CSR and Self-Signed Certificate:
```bash
openssl genrsa -out tls.key 2048
openssl req -new -key tls.key -out tls.csr -config openssl.cnf
openssl x509 -req -in tls.csr -signkey tls.key -out tls.crt -days 3650 -extensions v3_req -extfile openssl.cnf
```

Encode the contents of the TLS key and certificate and save the output for use in the helm values file, `my-powermax-settings.yaml`, below:
```
cat tls.crt | base64
cat tls.key | base64
```

### Install Helm 3

Install Helm 3 on the master node before you install CSI Driver for Dell PowerMax.

Run the following command to install Helm 3.
   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
   ```

### Fibre Channel Requirements

The following requirements must be fulfilled in order to successfully use the Fiber Channel protocol with the CSI PowerMax driver:

- Zoning of the Host Bus Adapters (HBAs) to the Fibre Channel port director must be completed.
- Ensure that the HBA WWNs (initiators) appear on the list of initiators that are logged into the array.
- If the number of volumes that will be published to nodes is high, then configure the maximum number of LUNs for your HBAs on each node. See the appropriate HBA document to configure the maximum number of LUNs.

### iSCSI Requirements

The following requirements must be fulfilled in order to successfully use the iSCSI protocol with the CSI PowerMax driver.

- Ensure that the necessary iSCSI initiator utilities are installed on each Kubernetes worker node. This typically includes the _iscsi-initiator-utils_ package for RHEL or _open-iscsi_ package for Ubuntu.
- Enable and start the _iscsid_ service on each Kubernetes worker node. This service is responsible for managing the iSCSI initiator. You can enable the service by running the following command on all worker nodes: `systemctl enable --now iscsid`
- Ensure that the unique initiator name is set in _/etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi_.
- To configure iSCSI in Red Hat OpenShift clusters, you can create a `MachineConfig` object using the console or `oc` to ensure that the iSCSI daemon starts on all the Red Hat CoreOS nodes. Here is an example of a `MachineConfig` object:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  name: 99-iscsid
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
    systemd:
      units:
      - name: "iscsid.service"
        enabled: true
```

Once the `MachineConfig` object has been deployed, CoreOS will ensure that the `iscsid.service` starts automatically. You can check the status of the iSCSI service by entering the following command on each worker node in the cluster: `sudo systemctl status iscsid`.

- Ensure that the iSCSI initiators are available on all the nodes where the driver node plugin will be installed.
- Ensure that the unique initiator name is set in _/etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi_.
- If your worker nodes are running Red Hat CoreOS, make sure that automatic iSCSI login at boot is configured. Please contact RedHat for more details.
- Kubernetes nodes must have network connectivity to an iSCSI director on the Dell PowerMax array that has IP interfaces. Manually create IP routes for each node that connects to the Dell PowerMax if required.
- Ensure that the iSCSI initiators on the nodes are not a part of any existing Host (Initiator Group) on the Dell PowerMax array.
- The CSI Driver needs the port group name containing the required iSCSI director ports. These port groups must be set up on each Dell PowerMax array. All the port group names supplied to the driver must exist on each Dell PowerMax with the same name.

Refer to the [Dell Host Connectivity Guide](https://elabnavigator.dell.com/vault/pdf/Linux.pdf) for more information.

### NVMe Requirements

The following requirements must be fulfilled in order to successfully use the NVMe/TCP protocol with the CSI PowerMax driver:

- Modules including the nvme, nvme_core, nvme_fabrics, and nvme_tcp are required for using NVMe over Fabrics using TCP. Load the NVMe and NVMe-OF Modules using the below commands:
```bash
modprobe nvme
modprobe nvme_tcp
```
- The NVMe modules may not be available after a node reboot. Loading the modules at startup is recommended.

> Starting with OCP 4.14 NVMe/TCP is enabled by default on RCOS nodes.

**Cluster requirments**

- All OpenShift or Kubernetes nodes connecting to Dell storage arrays must use unique host NVMe Qualified Names (NQNs).

> The OpenShift deployment process for CoreOS will set the same host NQN for all nodes. The host NQN is stored in the file /etc/nvme/hostnqn. One possible solution to ensure unique host NQNs is to add the following machine config to your OCP cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
  name: 99-worker-custom-nvme-hostnqn
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
    systemd:
      units:
        - contents: |
            [Unit]
            Description=Custom CoreOS Generate NVMe Hostnqn

            [Service]
            Type=oneshot
            ExecStart=/usr/bin/sh -c '/usr/sbin/nvme gen-hostnqn > /etc/nvme/hostnqn'
            RemainAfterExit=yes

            [Install]
            WantedBy=multi-user.target
          enabled: true
          name: custom-coreos-generate-nvme-hostnqn.service
```

- The driver requires the NVMe command-line interface (nvme-cli) to manage the NVMe clients and targets. The NVMe CLI tool is installed in the host using the following command on RPM oriented Linux distributions.

```bash
sudo dnf -y install nvme-cli
```

- Support for NVMe requires native NVMe multipathing to be configured on each worker node in the cluster. Please refer to the [Dell Host Connectivity Guide](https://elabnavigator.dell.com/vault/pdf/Linux.pdf) for more details on NVMe multipathing requirements. To determine if the worker nodes are configured for native NVMe multipathing run the following command on each worker node:

```bash
cat /sys/module/nvme_core/parameters/multipath
```

 >If the result of the command displays Y then NVMe native multipathing is enabled in the kernel. If the output is N then native NVMe multipating is disabled. Consult the [Dell Host Connectivity Guide](https://elabnavigator.dell.com/vault/pdf/Linux.pdf) for Linux to enable native NVMe multipathing.

**Configure the IO policy**

- The default NVMeTCP native multipathing policy is "numa". The preferred IO policy for NVMe devices used for PowerMax is round-robin. You can use udev rules to enable the round robin policy on all worker nodes. To view the IO policy you can use the following command:

```bash
nvme list-subsys
```

To change the IO policy to round-robin you can add a udev rule on each worker node. Place a config file in /etc/udev/rules.d with the name 71-nvme-io-policy.rules with the following contents:

```text
ACTION=="add|change", SUBSYSTEM=="nvme-subsystem", ATTR{iopolicy}="round-robin"
```

In order to change the rules on a running kernel you can run the following commands:

```bash
/sbin/udevadm control --reload-rules
/sbin/udevadm trigger --type=devices --action=change
```

On OCP clusters you can add a MachineConfig to enable this rule on all worker nodes:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  name: 99-workers-multipath-round-robin
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.4.0
    storage:
      files:
      - contents:
          source: data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,QUNUSU9OPT0iYWRkfGNoYW5nZSIsIFNVQlNZU1RFTT09Im52bWUtc3Vic3lzdGVtIiwgQVRUUntpb3BvbGljeX09InJvdW5kLXJvYmluIg==
          verification: {}
        filesystem: root
        mode: 420
        path: /etc/udev/rules.d/71-nvme-io-policy.rules
```

**Array requirements**

Once the NVMe endpoint is created on the array, follow the following steps to update the endpoint name to adhere to the CSI driver requirements.

   - Run  ```nvme discover --transport=tcp --traddr=<InterfaceAdd> --trsvcid=4420```. <InterfaceAdd> is the placeholder for actual IP address of NVMe Endpoint.
   - Fetch the _subnqn_, for e.g.,  _nqn.1988-11.com.dell:PowerMax_2500:00:000120001100_, this will be used as the subnqn holder while updating NVMe endpoint name.
   - Update the NVMe endpoint name as ```<subnqn>:<dir><port>>```. Here is an example how it should look, _nqn.1988-11.com.dell:PowerMax_2500:00:000120001100:OR1C000_

### NFS Requirements

CSI Driver for Dell PowerMax supports NFS communication. Ensure that the following requirements are met before you install CSI Driver:
- Configure the NFS network. Please refer [here](https://dl.dell.com/content/manual57826791-dell-powermax-file-protocol-guide.pdf?language=en-us&ps=true) for more details.
- PowerMax Embedded Management guest to access Unisphere for PowerMax.
- Create the NAS server. Please refer [here](https://dl.dell.com/content/manual55638050-dell-powermax-file-quick-start-guide.pdf?language=en-us&ps=true) for more details.

### Linux Multipathing Requirements

Dell PowerMax supports Linux multipathing (DM-MPIO) and NVMe native multipathing. Configure Linux multipathing before installing the CSI Driver.

> For NVMe connectivity native NVMe multipathing is used. The following sections apply only for iSCSI and Fiber Channel connectivity.

Configure Linux multipathing as follows:
- Ensure that all nodes have the _Device Mapper Multipathing_ package installed.
  You can install it by running `dnf install device-mapper-multipath` or `apt install multipath-tools` based on your Linux distribution.
- Ensure that the multipath command `mpathconf` is available on all Kubernetes nodes.
- Enable multipathing using the `mpathconf --enable --with_multipathd y` command.  A default configuration file, `/etc/multipath.conf` is created.
- Enable `user_friendly_names` and `find_multipaths` in the `multipath.conf` file.
- As a best practice, use these options to help the operating system and the mulitpathing software detect path changes efficiently:

```text
path_grouping_policy multibus
path_checker tur
features "1 queue_if_no_path"
path_selector "round-robin 0"
no_path_retry 10
```

The following is a sample multipath.conf file. You may have to adjust these values based on your environment.

```text
defaults {
  user_friendly_names yes
  find_multipaths yes
  path_grouping_policy multibus
  path_checker tur
  features "1 queue_if_no_path"
  path_selector "round-robin 0"
  no_path_retry 10
}
  blacklist {
}
```

On some distributions the multipathd service for changes to the configuration and dynamically reconfigures itself. If you need to manually trigger a reload you can run the following command:
`sudo systemctl reload multipathd`

To enable multipathd on RedHat CoreOS nodes you need to prepare a working configuration encoded in base64. For example you can run the following command to encode the above multipath.config file.

```text
echo 'defaults {
  user_friendly_names yes
  find_multipaths yes
  path_grouping_policy multibus
  path_checker tur
  features "1 queue_if_no_path"
  path_selector "round-robin 0"
  no_path_retry 10
}
  blacklist {
}' | base64 -w0
```

The output of the above command follows:
```text
ZGVmYXVsdHMgewogIHVzZXJfZnJpZW5kbHlfbmFtZXMgeWVzCiAgZmluZF9tdWx0aXBhdGhzIHllcwogIHBhdGhfZ3JvdXBpbmdfcG9saWN5IG11bHRpYnVzCiAgcGF0aF9jaGVja2VyIHR1cgogIGZlYXR1cmVzICIxIHF1ZXVlX2lmX25vX3BhdGgiCiAgcGF0aF9zZWxlY3RvciAicm91bmQtcm9iaW4gMCIKICBub19wYXRoX3JldHJ5IDEwCn0KICBibGFja2xpc3Qgewp9Cg==
```

Use the base64 encoded string output in the following `MachineConfig` yaml file (under source section)

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  name: workers-multipath-conf-default
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
    storage:
      files:
      - contents:
          source: data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,ZGVmYXVsdHMgewogIHVzZXJfZnJpZW5kbHlfbmFtZXMgeWVzCiAgZmluZF9tdWx0aXBhdGhzIHllcwogIHBhdGhfZ3JvdXBpbmdfcG9saWN5IG11bHRpYnVzCiAgcGF0aF9jaGVja2VyIHR1cgogIGZlYXR1cmVzICIxIHF1ZXVlX2lmX25vX3BhdGgiCiAgcGF0aF9zZWxlY3RvciAicm91bmQtcm9iaW4gMCIKICBub19wYXRoX3JldHJ5IDEwCn0KICBibGFja2xpc3Qgewp9Cg==
          verification: {}
        filesystem: root
        mode: 400
        path: /etc/multipath.conf
```

After deploying this`MachineConfig` object, CoreOS will start the multipath service automatically.
Alternatively, you can check the status of the multipath service by running the following command on each worker node.
`sudo multipath -ll`

Refer to the [Dell Host Connectivity Guide](https://elabnavigator.dell.com/vault/pdf/Linux.pdf) for more information.

### PowerPath for Linux requirements

The CSI Driver for Dell PowerMax supports PowerPath for Linux. Configure Linux PowerPath before installing the CSI Driver.

Follow this procedure to set up PowerPath for Linux:

- All the nodes must have the PowerPath package installed . Download the PowerPath archive for the environment from [Dell Online Support](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-in/product-support/product/powerpath-for-linux/drivers).
- `Untar` the PowerPath archive, Copy the RPM package into a temporary folder and Install PowerPath using `rpm -ivh DellEMCPower.LINUX-<version>-<build>.<platform>.x86_64.rpm`
- Start the PowerPath service using `systemctl start PowerPath`

>Note: Do not install Dell PowerPath if multi-path software is already installed, as they cannot co-exist with native multi-path software.

### Volume Snapshot Requirements (Optional)
  For detailed snapshot setup procedure, [click here.](../../../../../snapshots/#optional-volume-snapshot-requirements)

### Replication Requirements (Optional)

Applicable only if you decided to enable the Replication feature in `my-powermax-settings.yaml`

```yaml
replication:
  enabled: true
```
#### Replication CRD's

The CRDs for replication can be obtained and installed from the csm-replication project on Github. Use `csm-replication/deploy/replicationcrds.all.yaml` located in the csm-replication git repo for the installation.

CRDs should be configured during replication prepare stage with repctl as described in [install-repctl](../../../../../deployment/helm/modules/installation/replication/install-repctl)

## Installation

**Steps**

1. Clone the csi-powermax repository, using the latest release branch. This will include the Helm charts and dell-csi-helm-installer scripts.
    ```bash
    git clone -b v2.14.0 https://github.com/dell/csi-powermax.git
    ```
2. Create a namespace in which the driver will be installed.
    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace powermax
    ```
3. Edit the `samples/secret/secret.yaml` file, referencing the details below, to provide the necessary information for connecting the driver to the desired Unisphere instances.

    - *storageArrays*: A list of storage arrays and their associated details.
      - *storageArrayId*: A unique PowerMax Symmetrix ID.
      - *primaryEndpoint*: The URL of the Unisphere server managing this storage array.
      - *backupEndpoint*: The URL of the backup Unisphere server managing this storage array; utilized if the primary server is unreachable.
    - *managementServers*: A list of Unisphere management server endpoints and resources used to make connections with those servers.
      - *endpoint*: The URL of the Unisphere server (primary or backup). This should match one of the URLs listed under `storageArrays`.
      - *username*: The username to be used when connecting to the `endpoint`.
      - *password*: The password to be used when connecting to the `endpoint`.
      - *skipCertificateValidation*: Set to `false` to perform client-side TLS certificate verification for the Unisphere instance, `true` to skip verification.

    Example: `samples/secret/secret.yaml`

    ```yaml
    storageArrays:
      - storageArrayId: "000000000001"
        primaryEndpoint: https://primary-1.unisphe.re:8443
        backupEndpoint: https://backup-1.unisphe.re:8443
    managementServers:
      - endpoint: https://primary-1.unisphe.re:8443
        username: admin
        password: password
        skipCertificateValidation: true
      - endpoint: https://backup-1.unisphe.re:8443
        username: admin2
        password: Password123
        skipCertificateValidation: false
    ```
4. Create the powermax-reverseproxy-secret Secret.
    ```bash
    kubectl create secret generic powermax-reverseproxy-secret --namespace powermax --from-file=config=samples/secret/secret.yaml
    ```
5. Download the default values.yaml file.
    ```bash
    cd dell-csi-helm-installer && wget -O my-powermax-settings.yaml https://github.com/dell/helm-charts/raw/csi-powermax-2.14.0/charts/csi-powermax/values.yaml
    ```
6. Confirm REST API support for the Unisphere server by checking it is version 10.0, or later. From the Unisphere for PowerMax GUI, click Help (?) -> About.
7. Edit the newly created file and provide values for the following parameters
    ```bash
    vi my-powermax-settings.yaml
    ```

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Required   | Default  |

8. Make sure to provide the base64 encoded TLS certificate and key contents created in the [CSI PowerMax Reverse Proxy](#csi-powermax-reverse-proxy) prerequisite step above.
    ```yaml
    csireverseproxy:
      tlsSecret: csirevproxy-tls-secret
      deployAsSidecar: false
      port: 2222
      secretName: csi-reverseproxy-secret
      certManager:
        selfSignedCert: false
        certificateFile: |

          IGZpbGUK
    ```
9. Install the driver using `csi-install.sh` bash script in the `dell-csi-helm-installer` directory by running
    ```bash
    ./csi-install.sh --namespace powermax --values ./my-powermax-settings.yaml --helm-charts-version <version>
    ```
10. Or you can also install the driver using standalone helm chart using the command
    ```bash
    helm install powermax ./csi-powermax --namespace powermax --values my-powermax-settings.yaml
    ```

> Notes:
> - The parameter `--helm-charts-version` is optional and if you do not specify the flag, by default the `csi-install.sh` script will clone the version of the helm chart that is specified in the driver's [csi-install.sh](https://github.com/dell/csi-powermax/blob/main/dell-csi-helm-installer/csi-install.sh#L52) file. If you wish to install the driver using a different version of the helm chart, you need to include this flag. Also, remember to delete the `helm-charts` repository present in the `csi-powermax` directory if it was cloned before.
> - For detailed instructions on how to run the install scripts, see the README document in the dell-csi-helm-installer folder.
> - There are a set of samples provided [here](#sample-values-file) to help you configure the driver with reverse proxy
> - This script also runs the verify.sh script in the same directory. You will be prompted to enter the credentials for each of the Kubernetes nodes. The `verify.sh` script needs the credentials to check if the iSCSI initiators have been configured on all nodes. You can also skip the verification step by specifying the `--skip-verify-node` option
> - In order to enable CSM Authorization, there should be an authorization proxy server already installed.
> - PowerMax Array username must have role as `StorageAdmin` to be able to perform CRUD operations.
> - If the user is using complex K8s version like “v1.24.3-mirantis-1”, use this kubeVersion check in [helm Chart](https://github.com/dell/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/csi-powermax/Chart.yaml) file. `kubeVersion: “>= 1.24.0-0 < 1.29.0-0”`.
> - User should provide all boolean values with double-quotes. This applies only for `my-powermax-settings.yaml`. Example: “true”/“false”.
> - The `controllerCount` parameter value should be <= number of nodes in the kubernetes cluster, otherwise the install script will fail.
> - Endpoints should not have any special characters at the end (e.g. trailing forward slash) apart from port number.

## Storage Classes

A wide set of annotated storage class manifests has been provided in the `samples/storageclass` folder. Please use these samples to create new storage classes to provision storage.

## Volume Snapshot Class

Starting with CSI PowerMax v1.7.0, `dell-csi-helm-installer` will not create any Volume Snapshot Class during the driver installation. There is a sample Volume Snapshot Class manifest present in the _samples/volumesnapshotclass_ folder. Please use this sample to create a new Volume Snapshot Class to use when creating Volume Snapshots.

## Sample values file

The following sections have useful snippets from `values.yaml` file which provides more information on how to configure the CSI PowerMax driver along with CSI PowerMax ReverseProxy.

### CSI PowerMax driver with Reverse Proxy

This is the most advanced configuration which provides you with the capability to connect to Multiple Unisphere servers.
You can specify primary and backup Unisphere servers for each storage array. If you have different credentials for your Unisphere servers, you can also specify different credential secrets.

```yaml
# "csireverseproxy" refers to the subchart csireverseproxy
csireverseproxy:
  tlsSecret: csirevproxy-tls-secret
  deployAsSidecar: true
  port: 2222
  secretName: powermax-reverseproxy-secret
  certManager:
    selfSignedCert: "true"
