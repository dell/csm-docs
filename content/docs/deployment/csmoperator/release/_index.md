### Known Issues
| Issue | Workaround |
|-------|------------|
| The images of sideCars are currently missing in the sample YAMLs in the offline bundle. As a consequence, the csm-operator is pulling them from registry.k8s.io. | We recommend manually updating the images of sideCars in the sample YAML file, for example, `storage_csm_powerflex_v291.yaml`, before proceeding with the driver installation. Here is an example snippet for the sideCars section in the YAML file:

  ```yaml
  sideCars:
    # 'k8s' represents a string prepended to each volume created by the CSI driver
    - name: provisioner
      image: <localregistry>/csi-provisioner:v3.6.2
      args: ["--volume-name-prefix=k8s"]
    - name: attacher
      image: <localregistry>/csi-attacher:v4.4.2
    - name: registrar
      image: <localregistry>/csi-node-driver-registrar:v2.9.1
    - name: resizer
      image: <localregistry>/csi-resizer:v1.9.2
    - name: snapshotter
      image: <localregistry>/csi-snapshotter:v6.3.2

    # sdc-monitor is disabled by default, due to high CPU usage
    - name: sdc-monitor
      enabled: false
      image: <localregistry>/sdc:4.5
      envs:
        - name: HOST_PID
          value: "1"
        - name: MDM
          value: "10.xx.xx.xx,10.xx.xx.xx" # Do not add mdm value here if it is present in secret

    # health monitor is disabled by default, refer to driver documentation before enabling it
    # Also set the env variable controller.envs.X_CSI_HEALTH_MONITOR_ENABLED to "true".
    - name: csi-external-health-monitor-controller
      enabled: false
      image: <localregistry>/csi-external-health-monitor-controller:v0.10.0
      args: ["--monitor-interval=60s"]
