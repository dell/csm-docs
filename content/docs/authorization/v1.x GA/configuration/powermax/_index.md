  Enabling CSM Authorization for PowerMax CSI Driver

## Configuring PowerMax CSI Driver with CSM for Authorization

Given a setup where Kubernetes, a storage system, and the CSM for Authorization Proxy Server are deployed, follow these steps to configure the CSI Drivers to work with the Authorization sidecar:

1. Apply the secret containing the tenant token data into the driver namespace. It's assumed that the Kubernetes administrator has the token secret manifest, generated by your storage administrator via [Generate a Token](../proxy-server/#generate-a-token), saved in `/tmp/token.yaml`.

   #It is assumed that array type powermax has the namespace "powermax".
   ```console
      kubectl apply -f /tmp/token.yaml -n powermax
   ```

2. Edit these parameters in `samples/secret/karavi-authorization-config.json` file in [CSI PowerMax](https://github.com/dell/csi-powermax/tree/main/samples/secret) driver and update/add connection information for one or more backend storage arrays. In an instance where multiple CSI drivers are configured on the same Kubernetes cluster, the port range in the *endpoint* parameter must be different for each driver.

  | Parameter | Description | Required | Default |
   | --------- | ----------- | -------- |-------- |
   | username | Username for connecting to the backend storage array. This parameter is ignored. | No | - |
   | password | Password for connecting to to the backend storage array. This parameter is ignored. | No | - |
   | intendedEndpoint | HTTPS REST API endpoint of the backend storage array. | Yes | - |
   | endpoint | HTTPS localhost endpoint that the authorization sidecar will listen on. | Yes | https://localhost:9400 |
   | systemID | System ID of the backend storage array. | Yes | " " |
   | skipCertificateValidation  | A boolean that enables/disables certificate validation of the backend storage array. This parameter is not used. | No | true |
   | isDefault | A boolean that indicates if the array is the default array. This parameter is not used. | No | default value from values.yaml |


Create the karavi-authorization-config secret using this command:
  ```bash

  kubectl -n powermax create secret generic karavi-authorization-config --from-file=config=samples/secret/karavi-authorization-config.json -o yaml --dry-run=client | kubectl apply -f -
  ```

3. Create the proxy-server-root-certificate secret.

    If running in *insecure* mode, create the secret with empty data:

      ```bash

      kubectl -n powermax create secret generic proxy-server-root-certificate --from-literal=rootCertificate.pem= -o yaml --dry-run=client | kubectl apply -f -
      ```

    Otherwise, create the proxy-server-root-certificate secret with the appropriate file:

      ```bash

      kubectl -n powermax create secret generic proxy-server-root-certificate --from-file=rootCertificate.pem=/path/to/rootCA -o yaml --dry-run=client | kubectl apply -f -
      ```

4. Prepare the driver configuration secret, applicable to your driver installation method, to communicate with the CSM Authorization sidecar.

    **Helm**

    Refer to the [Install the Driver](../../../deployment/helm/drivers/installation/powermax/#install-the-driver) section where you edit `samples/secret/secret.yaml` with the credentials of the PowerMax. Leave `username` and `password` with the default values as they will be ignored.

    **Operator**

    Refer to the [Install the Driver](../../../deployment/csmoperator/drivers/powermax/#install-driver) section to prepare `powermax-creds.yaml`. Leave `username` and `password` with the default values as they will be ignored.

5. Enable CSM Authorization in the driver installation applicable to your installation method.

    **Helm**

    Refer to the [Install the Driver](../../../deployment/helm/drivers/installation/powermax/#install-the-driver) section to edit the parameters in `my-powermax-settings.yaml` file to configure the driver to communicate with the CSM Authorization sidecar.

    - Update `global.storageArrays.endpoint` to match the localhost endpoint in `samples/secret/karavi-authorization-config.json`.

    - Update `global.managementServers.endpoint` to match the localhost endpoint in `samples/secret/karavi-authorization-config.json`.

    - Update `authorization.enabled` to `true`.
    
    - Update `images.authorization` to the image of the CSM Authorization sidecar. In most cases, you can leave the default value.

    - Update `authorization.proxyHost` to the hostname of the CSM Authorization Proxy Server. `csm-authorization.com` is a placeholder for the proxyHost. See the administrator of CSM for Authorization for the correct value.
    
    - Update `authorization.skipCertificateValidation` to `true` or `false` depending on if you want to disable or enable certificate validation of the CSM Authorization Proxy Server.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    global:
      storageArrays:
        - storageArrayId: "123456789"
          endpoint: https://localhost:9400
      managementServers:
        - endpoint: https://localhost:9400

    authorization:
      enabled: true

      # sidecarProxyImage: the container image used for the csm-authorization-sidecar.
      # Default value: dellemc/csm-authorization-sidecar:v1.10.0
      sidecarProxyImage: dellemc/csm-authorization-sidecar:v1.10.0

      # proxyHost: hostname of the csm-authorization server
      # Default value: None
      proxyHost: csm-authorization.com

      # skipCertificateValidation: certificate validation of the csm-authorization server
      # Allowed Values:
      #   "true" - TLS certificate verification will be skipped
      #   "false" - TLS certificate will be verified 
      # Default value: "true" 
      skipCertificateValidation: true
    ```

    **Operator**

    Refer to the [Install Driver](../../../deployment/csmoperator/drivers/powermax/#install-driver) section to edit the parameters in the Custom Resource to enable CSM Authorization.

    Under `modules`, enable the module named `authorization`:

    - Update the `enabled` field to `true.`

    - Update the `image` to the image of the CSM Authorization sidecar. In most cases, you can leave the default value.

    - Update the `PROXY_HOST` environment value to the hostname of the CSM Authorization Proxy Server. `csm-authorization.com` is a placeholder for the proxyHost. See the administrator of CSM for Authorization for the correct value.

    - Update the `SKIP_CERTIFICATE_VALIDATION` environment value to `true` or `false` depending on if you want to disable or enable certificate validation of the CSM Authorization Proxy Server.

    Example: 

    ```yaml
    modules:
      # Authorization: enable csm-authorization for RBAC
      - name: authorization
        # enable: Enable/Disable csm-authorization
        enabled: true
        configVersion: v1.10.0
        components:
        - name: karavi-authorization-proxy
          image: dellemc/csm-authorization-sidecar:v1.10.0
          envs:
            # proxyHost: hostname of the csm-authorization server
            - name: "PROXY_HOST"
              value: "csm-authorization.com"
          
            # skipCertificateValidation: Enable/Disable certificate validation of the csm-authorization server       
            - name: "SKIP_CERTIFICATE_VALIDATION"
              value: "true"
    ```

5. Install the Dell CSI PowerMax driver following the appropriate documenation for your installation method.

6. (Optional) Install [dellctl](../../../references/cli) to perform Kubernetes administrator commands for additional capabilities (e.g., list volumes). Please refer to the [dellctl documentation page](../../../references/cli) for the installation steps and command list.
