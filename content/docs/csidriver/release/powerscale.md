### Known Issues
| Issue                                                        | Resolution or workaround, if known                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| If the length of the nodeID exceeds 128 characters, the driver fails to update the CSINode object and installation fails. This is due to a limitation set by CSI spec which doesn't allow nodeID to be greater than 128 characters. | The CSI PowerScale driver uses the hostname for building the nodeID which is set in the CSINode resource object, hence we recommend not having very long hostnames in order to avoid this issue. This current limitation of 128 characters is likely to be relaxed in future Kubernetes versions as per this issue in the community: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gcp-compute-persistent-disk-csi-driver/issues/581 <br><br> **Note:** In kubernetes 1.22 this limit has been relaxed to 192 characters.|
| If some older NFS exports /terminated worker nodes still in NFS export client list, CSI driver tries to add a new worker node it fails (For RWX volume). | User need to manually clean the export client list from old entries to make successful additon of new worker nodes.
