| Delete namespace that has PVCs and pods created with the driver. The External health monitor sidecar crashes as a result of this operation | Deleting the namespace deletes the PVCs first and then removes the pods in the namespace. This brings a condition where pods exist without their PVCs and causes the external-health-monitor sidecar to crash. This is a known issue and has been reported at https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-health-monitor/issues/100 <br> |
