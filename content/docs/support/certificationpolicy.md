To ensure secure and certified solutions, Dell initiates the Red Hat OpenShift Operator Certification process immediately following the public release of Dell Container Storage Modules. This includes validation of the Operator bundle, container image compliance, and compatibility with OpenShift standards. Once certified, the Operator is published to the OpenShift Catalog for trusted deployment.
