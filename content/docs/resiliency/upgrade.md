## Helm Chart Upgrade

To upgrade CSM for Resiliency with the driver, the following steps are required. 

>Note: These steps refer to the values file and `csi-install.sh` script that were used during initial installation of the Dell CSI driver.

**Steps**

1. Update the podmon.image value in the values files to reference the new podmon image.
2. Run the csi-install script with the option --upgrade by running: 
```bash

cd ../dell-csi-helm-installer && ./csi-install.sh --namespace vxflexos --values ./myvalues.yaml --upgrade
```
