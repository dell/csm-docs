The CSM Authorization RPM will be deprecated in a future release. It is highly recommended that you use CSM Authorization Helm deployment or CSM Operator going forward.

The Dell Technologies (Dell) Container Storage Modules (CSM) enables simple and consistent integration and automation experiences, extending enterprise storage capabilities to Kubernetes for cloud-native stateful applications. It reduces management complexity so developers can independently consume enterprise storage with ease and automate daily operations such as provisioning, snapshotting, replication, observability, authorization, application mobility, encryption, and resiliency.

CSM is made up of multiple components including modules (enterprise capabilities), CSI drivers (storage enablement), and other related applications (deployment, feature controllers, etc).

  CSM for Authorization provides storage and Kubernetes administrators the ability to apply RBAC for Dell CSI Drivers. It does this by deploying a proxy between the CSI driver and the storage system to enforce role-based access and usage rules.<br>
