## Enabling Replication in CSI PowerScale

Container Storage Modules (CSM) Replication sidecar is a helper container that is installed alongside a CSI driver to facilitate replication functionality. Such CSI drivers must implement `dell-csi-extensions` calls.

CSI driver for Dell PowerScale supports necessary extension calls from `dell-csi-extensions`. To be able to provision replicated volumes you would need to do the steps described in the following sections.

### Before Installation

#### On Storage Array
Ensure that SyncIQ service is enabled on both arrays, you can do that by navigating to `SyncIQ` section under `Data protection` tab. 

The current implementation supports one-to-one replication so you need to ensure that one array can reach another and vice versa. 

##### SyncIQ encryption

If you wish to use `SyncIQ` encryption you should ensure that you've added a server certificate first by navigating to `Data protection->SyncIQ->Settings`. 

After adding the certificate, you can choose to use it by checking `Encrypt SyncIQ connection` from the dropdown. 

After that, you can add similar certificates of other arrays in `SyncIQ-> Certificates`, and ensure you've added the certificate of the array you want to replicate to. 

Similar steps should be done in the reverse direction, so `array-1` has the `array-2` certificate visible in `SyncIQ-> Certificates` tab and `array-2` has the `array-1` certificate visible in its own `SyncIQ->Certificates` tab. 

#### In Kubernetes
Ensure you installed CRDs and replication controller in your clusters.

To verify you have everything in order you can execute the following commands:

* Check controller pods:
    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n dell-replication-controller
    ```
  Pods should be `READY` and `RUNNING`.
* Check that controller config map is properly populated:
    ```shell
    
    kubectl get cm -n dell-replication-controller dell-replication-controller-config -o yaml
    ```
  `data` field should be properly populated with cluster-id of your choosing and, if using multi-cluster
  installation, your `targets:` parameter should be populated by a list of target clusters IDs.


If you don't have something installed or something is out-of-place, please refer to installation instructions [here](../installation).

### Installing Driver With Replication Module

To install the driver with replication enabled, you need to ensure you have set
helm parameter `controller.replication.enabled` in your copy of example `values.yaml` file
(usually called `my-isilon-settings.yaml`, `myvalues.yaml` etc.).

Here is an example of what that would look like:
```yaml
...
# controller: configure controller specific parameters
controller:
  ...
  # replication: allows to configure replication
  replication:
    enabled: true
    image: dellemc/dell-csi-replicator:v1.6.0
    replicationContextPrefix: "powerscale"
    replicationPrefix: "replication.storage.dell.com"
...
```
You can leave other parameters like `image`, `replicationContextPrefix`, and `replicationPrefix` as they are.

After enabling the replication module, you can continue to install the CSI driver for PowerScale following the usual installation procedure. Just ensure you've added the necessary array connection information to the Kubernetes secret for the PowerScale driver.

> **_NOTE:_** You need to install your driver on all clusters where you want to use replication. Both arrays must be accessible from each cluster.

##### SyncIQ encryption

If you plan to use encryption, you need to set `replicationCertificateID` in the array connection secret. To check the ID of the certificate for the cluster, you can navigate to `Data protection->SyncIQ->Settings,` find your certificate in the `Server Certificates` section and then push the `View/Edit` button. It will open a dialog that should contain the  `Id` field. Use the value of that field to set `replicationCertificateID`.


### Creating Storage Classes

To provision replicated volumes, you need to create adequately configured storage classes on both the source and target clusters.

A pair of storage classes on the source, and target clusters would be essentially `mirrored` copies of one another.
You can create them manually or with the help of `repctl`.

#### Manual Storage Class Creation

You can find a sample replication enabled storage class in the driver repository [here](https://github.com/dell/csi-powerscale/blob/main/samples/storageclass/isilon-replication.yaml).

It will look like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: isilon-replication
provisioner: csi-isilon.dellemc.com
reclaimPolicy: Delete
allowVolumeExpansion: true
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
parameters:
  replication.storage.dell.com/isReplicationEnabled: "true"
  replication.storage.dell.com/remoteStorageClassName: "isilon-replication"
  replication.storage.dell.com/remoteClusterID: "target"
  replication.storage.dell.com/remoteSystem: "cluster-2"
  replication.storage.dell.com/remoteAccessZone: System
  replication.storage.dell.com/remoteAzServiceIP: 192.168.1.2
  replication.storage.dell.com/remoteRootClientEnabled: "false"
  replication.storage.dell.com/rpo: Five_Minutes
  replication.storage.dell.com/ignoreNamespaces: "false"
  replication.storage.dell.com/volumeGroupPrefix: "csi"
  AccessZone: System
  AzServiceIP: 192.168.1.1
  IsiPath: /ifs/data/csi
  RootClientEnabled: "false"
  ClusterName: cluster-1
```

Let's go through each parameter and what it means:
* `replication.storage.dell.com/isReplicationEnabled` if set to `true`, will mark this storage class as replication enabled,
  just leave it as `true`.
* `replication.storage.dell.com/remoteStorageClassName` points to the name of the remote storage class. If you are using replication with the multi-cluster configuration you can make it the same as the current storage class name.
* `replication.storage.dell.com/remoteClusterID` represents the ID of a remote Kubernetes cluster. It is the same ID you put in the replication controller config map.
* `replication.storage.dell.com/remoteSystem` is the name of the remote PowerScale system that should match whatever `clusterName` you called it in `isilon-creds` secret.
* `replication.storage.dell.com/remoteAccessZone` is the name of the access zone a remote volume can be created in.
* `replication.storage.dell.com/remoteAzServiceIP` AccessZone groupnet service IP. It is optional and can be provided if different than the remote system endpoint.
* `replication.storage.dell.com/remoteRootClientEnabled` determines whether the driver should enable root squashing or not for the remote volume.
* `replication.storage.dell.com/rpo` is an acceptable amount of data, which is measured in units of time, that may be lost due to a failure.
> **_NOTE_**: Available RPO values "Five_Minutes", "Fifteen_Minutes", "Thirty_Minutes", "One_Hour", "Six_Hours", "Twelve_Hours", "One_Day"
* `replication.storage.dell.com/ignoreNamespaces`, if set to `true` PowerScale driver, it will ignore in what namespace volumes are created and put every volume created using this storage class into a single volume group.
* `replication.storage.dell.com/volumeGroupPrefix` represents what string would be appended to the volume group name to differentiate them. It is important to not use the same prefix for different kubernetes clusters, otherwise any action on a replication group in one kubernetes cluster will impact the other.

> **_NOTE_**: To configure the VolumeGroupPrefix, the name format of \'\<volumeGroupPrefix\>-\<namespace\>-\<System IP Address OR FQDN\>-\<rpo\>\' cannot be more than 63 characters.

* `Accesszone` is the name of the access zone a volume can be created in.
* `AzServiceIP` AccessZone groupnet service IP. It is optional and can be provided if different than the PowerScale cluster endpoint.
* `IsiPath` is the base path for the volumes to be created on the PowerScale cluster. If not specified in the storage class, the IsiPath defined in the storage array's secret will be used. If that is not specified, the IsiPath defined in the values.yaml file used for driver installation is used as the lowest-priority. IsiPath between source and target Replication Groups **must** be consistent.
* `RootClientEnabled` determines whether the driver should enable root squashing or not.
* `ClusterName` name of PowerScale cluster, where PV will be provisioned, specified as it was listed in `isilon-creds` secret.

After creating storage class YAML files, they must be applied to
your Kubernetes clusters with `kubectl`.

#### Storage Class creation with `repctl`

`repctl` can simplify storage class creation by creating a pair of mirrored storage classes in both clusters
(using a single storage class configuration) in one command.

To create storage classes with `repctl` you need to fill up the config with necessary information.
You can find an example [here](https://github.com/dell/csm-replication/blob/main/repctl/examples/powerscale_example_values.yaml), copy it, and modify it to your needs.

If you open this example you can see similar fields and parameters to what was seen in manual storage class creation.

Let's use the same example from manual installation and see what its repctl config file would look like:
```yaml
sourceClusterID: "source"
targetClusterID: "target"
name: "isilon-replication"
driver: "isilon"
reclaimPolicy: "Delete"
replicationPrefix: "replication.storage.dell.com"
remoteRetentionPolicy:
  RG: "Delete"
  PV: "Delete"
parameters:
  rpo: "Five_Minutes"
  ignoreNamespaces: "false"
  volumeGroupPrefix: "csi"
  isiPath: "/ifs/data/csi"
  clusterName:
    source: "cluster-1"
    target: "cluster-2"
  rootClientEnabled:
    source: "false"
    target: "false"
  accessZone:
    source: "System"
    target: "System"
  azServiceIP:
    source: "192.168.1.1"
    target: "192.168.1.2"
```

After preparing the config, you can apply it to both clusters with `repctl`. Before you do this, ensure you've added your clusters to `repctl` via the `add` command.

To create storage classes just run `./repctl create sc --from-config <config-file>` and storage classes

After creating storage classes you can make sure they are in place by using `./repctl get storageclasses` command.

### Provisioning Replicated Volumes

After installing the driver and creating storage classes, you are good to create volumes using the newly
created storage classes.

On your source cluster, create a PersistentVolumeClaim using one of the replication-enabled Storage Classes.
The CSI PowerScale driver will create a volume on the array, add it to a VolumeGroup and configure replication
using the parameters provided in the replication enabled Storage Class.

### Supported Replication Actions
The CSI PowerScale driver supports the following list of replication actions:
- FAILOVER_REMOTE
- UNPLANNED_FAILOVER_LOCAL
- FAILBACK_LOCAL
- ACTION_FAILBACK_DISCARD_CHANGES_LOCAL
- REPROTECT_LOCAL
- SUSPEND
- RESUME
- SYNC
