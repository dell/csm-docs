Container Storage Modules for Application Mobility provide Kubernetes administrators the ability to clone their stateful application workloads and application data to other clusters, either on-premise or in the cloud.

Application Mobility uses [Velero](https://velero.io) and its integration of [Restic](https://restic.net) to copy both application metadata and data to object storage. When a backup is requested, Application Mobility uses these options to determine how the application data is backed up:
- If [Volume Group Snapshots](../snapshots/volume-group-snapshots/) are enabled on the CSI driver backing the application's Persistent Volumes, crash consistent snapshots of all volumes are used for the backup.
- If [Volume Snapshots](../snapshots/) are enabled on the Kubernetes cluster and supported by the CSI driver, individual snapshots are used for each Persistent Volume used by the application.
- If no snapshot options are enabled, default to using full copies of each Persistent Volume used by the application.

After a backup has been created, it can be restored on the same Kubernetes cluster or any other cluster(s) if this criteria is met:
- Application Mobility is installed on the target cluster(s).
- The target cluster(s) has access to the object store bucket. For example, if backing up and restoring an application from an on-premise Kubernetes cluster to AWS EKS, an S3 bucket can be used if both the on-premise and EKS cluster have access to it.
- Storage Class is defined on the target cluster(s) to support creating the required Persistent Volumes used by the application.
