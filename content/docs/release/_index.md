## Container Storage Modules Release and Support Lifecycle:

Container Storage Modules Release and Support Lifecycle
The Container Storage Module Release and Support Lifecycle document helps CSM developers plan deployments and encourage timely upgrades for the latest functionality and fixes.

**Policies:**
- Each release is fully supported for 12 months. Refer to the matrix for GA and EOL dates of supported versions.
- If running a version older than 12 months, upgrade to a newer version or submit cert-csi test results to Dell support.
