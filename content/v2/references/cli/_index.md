## Installation instructions
1. Download `dellctl` from [here](https://github.com/dell/csm/releases/tag/v1.6.0).
2. chmod +x dellctl
3. Move `dellctl` to `/usr/local/bin` or add `dellctl`'s containing directory path to PATH environment variable.
4. Run `dellctl --help` to know available commands or run `dellctl command --help` to know more about a specific command.

By default, the `dellctl` runs against local cluster(referenced by `KUBECONFIG` environment variable or by a kube config file present at default location).
The user can register one or more remote clusters for `dellctl`, and run any `dellctl` command against these clusters by specifying the registered cluster id to the command.
