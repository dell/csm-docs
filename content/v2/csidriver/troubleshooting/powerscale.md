Here are some installation failures that might be encountered and how to mitigate them.

| Symptoms | Prevention, Resolution or Workaround |
|------------|--------------|
|The `kubectl logs isilon-controller-0 -n isilon -c driver` logs shows the driver **cannot authenticate** | Check your secret's username and password for corresponding cluster |
|The `kubectl logs isilon-controller-0 -n isilon -c driver` logs shows the driver failed to connect to the Isilon because it **couldn't verify the certificates** |  Check the isilon-certs-<n> secret and ensure it is not empty and it has the valid certificates. Set `isiInsecure: "true"` for insecure connection. SSL validation is recommended in the production environment. |
|The `kubectl logs isilon-controller-0 -n isilon -c driver` logs shows the driver error: **create volume failed, Access denied. create directory as requested** | This situation can happen when the user who created the base path is different from the user configured for the driver. Make sure the user used to deploy CSI-Driver must have enough rights on the base path (i.e. isiPath) to perform all operations. |
|Volume/filesystem is allowed to mount by any host in the network, though that host is not a part of the export of that particular volume under /ifs directory | "Dell EMC PowerScale: OneFS NFS Design Considerations and Best Practices": <br> There is a default shared directory (ifs) of OneFS, which lets clients running Windows, UNIX, Linux, or Mac OS X access the same directories and files. It is recommended to disable the ifs shared directory in a production environment and create dedicated NFS exports and SMB shares for your workload. |
| Creating snapshot fails if the parameter IsiPath in volume snapshot class and related storage class is not the same. The driver uses the incorrect IsiPath parameter and tries to locate the source volume due to the inconsistency. | Ensure IsiPath in VolumeSnapshotClass yaml and related storageClass yaml are the same. |
| While deleting a volume, if there are files or folders created on the volume that are owned by different users. If the Isilon credentials used are for a nonprivileged Isilon user, the delete volume action fails. It is due to the limitation in Linux permission control. | To perform the delete volume action, the user account must be assigned a role that has the privilege ISI_PRIV_IFS_RESTORE. The user account must have the following set of privileges to ensure that all the CSI Isilon driver capabilities work properly:<br> * ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_PAPI<br> * ISI_PRIV_NFS<br> * ISI_PRIV_QUOTA<br> * ISI_PRIV_SNAPSHOT<br> * ISI_PRIV_IFS_RESTORE<br> * ISI_PRIV_NS_IFS_ACCESS<br> In some cases, ISI_PRIV_BACKUP is also required, for example, when files owned by other users have mode bits set to 700. |
| If the hostname is mapped to loopback IP in /etc/hosts file, and pods are created using 1.3.0.1 release, after upgrade to driver version 1.4.0 or later there is a possibility of "localhost" as a stale entry in export | Recommended setup: User should not map a hostname to loopback IP in /etc/hosts file |
| CSI Driver installation fails with the error message "error getting FQDN". | Map IP address of host with its FQDN in /etc/hosts file.     |
| Driver node pod is in "CrashLoopBackOff" as "Node ID" generated is not with proper FQDN. | This might be due to "dnsPolicy" implemented on the driver node pod which may differ with different networks. <br><br> This parameter is configurable in both helm and Operator installer and the user can try with different "dnsPolicy" according to the environment.|
