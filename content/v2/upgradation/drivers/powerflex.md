Description: Upgrade PowerFlex CSI driver
---

You can upgrade the CSI Driver for Dell EMC PowerFlex using Helm or Dell CSI Operator.

## Update Driver from v1.3/v1.4 to v1.5 using Helm 
**Steps**
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/dell/csi-powerflex.git` to clone the git repository and get the v1.5 driver.
2. You need to create config.json with the configuration of your system.
   Check this section in installation documentation:  [Install the Driver](../../../installation/helm/powerflex#install-the-driver)
   You must set the only system managed in v1.4/v1.3 driver as default in config.json in v1.5 so that the driver knows the existing volumes belong to that system.
3. Update values file as needed.
4. Run the `csi-install` script with the option _\-\-upgrade_ by running: `cd ../dell-csi-helm-installer && ./csi-install.sh --namespace vxflexos --values ./myvalues.yaml --upgrade`.

*NOTE:*
- If you are upgrading from a driver version that was installed using Helm v2, ensure that you install Helm3 before installing the driver.
- Installation of the CSI Driver for Dell EMC PowerFlex version 1.5 driver is not supported on Kubernetes upstream clusters running version 1.17. You must upgrade your cluster to 1.19, 1.20, or 1.21 before attempting to install the new version of the driver.
- To update any installation parameter after the driver has been installed, change the `myvalues.yaml` file and run the install script with the option _\-\-upgrade_, for example: `./csi-install.sh --namespace vxflexos --values ./myvalues.yaml --upgrade`.

## Upgrade using Dell CSI Operator:
1. Clone the [Dell CSI Operator repository](https://github.com/dell/dell-csi-operator). 

2. Execute `bash scripts/install.sh --upgrade`
This command will install the latest version of the operator.
>Note: Dell CSI Operator version 1.4.0 and higher would install to the 'dell-csi-operator' namespace by default.

3. To upgrade the driver, refer [here](./../../../installation/operator/#update-csi-drivers).
