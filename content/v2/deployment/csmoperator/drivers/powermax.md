The CSI Driver for Dell PowerMax can be installed via the Dell CSM Operator.
To deploy the Operator, follow the instructions available [here](../../#installation).

Note that the deployment of the driver using the operator does not use any Helm charts and the installation and configuration parameters will be slightly different from the one specified via the Helm installer.

### Listing installed drivers

To query for all Dell CSI drivers installed with the ContainerStorageModule CRD use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get csm --all-namespaces
```

## Prerequisites

The following requirements must be met before installing the CSI Driver for Dell PowerMax:

- A Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster (see [supported versions](../../../../csidriver/#features-and-capabilities)).
- If enabling CSM for Authorization, please refer to the Authorization deployment steps first
- If enabling CSM Replication, both source and target storage systems must be locally managed by Unisphere.
  - _Example_: When using two Unisphere instances, the first Unisphere instance should be configured with the source storage system as locally
  managed and target storage system as remotely managed. The second Unisphere configuration should mirror the first â€” locally managing the target storage system and
  remotely managing the source storage system.
- Refer to the sections below for protocol specific requirements.
- For NVMe support the preferred multipath solution is NVMe native multipathing. The [Dell Host Connectivity Guide](https://elabnavigator.dell.com/vault/pdf/Linux.pdf) describes the details of each configuration option.
- Linux multipathing requirements (described later).
- PowerPath for Linux requirements (described later).
- Mount propagation is enabled on the container runtime that is being used.
- If using Snapshot feature, satisfy all Volume Snapshot requirements.
- Insecure registries are defined in Docker or other container runtime for CSI drivers that are hosted in a non-secure location.
- Ensure that your nodes support mounting NFS volumes if using NFS.
- Auto RDM for vSphere over FC requirements

### CSI PowerMax Reverse Proxy

The CSI PowerMax Reverse Proxy is a component that will be installed with the CSI PowerMax driver. For more details on this feature, see the related [documentation](../../../../csidriver/features/powermax/#csi-powermax-reverse-proxy).

Create a TLS secret that holds an SSL certificate and a private key. This is required by the reverse proxy server.
Use a tool such as `openssl` to generate this secret using the example below:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out tls.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key tls.key -out tls.crt -days 3650
kubectl create secret -n <namespace> tls csirevproxy-tls-secret --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key
```

### Fibre Channel Requirements

The following requirements must be fulfilled in order to successfully use the Fiber Channel protocol with the CSI PowerMax driver:

- Zoning of the Host Bus Adapters (HBAs) to the Fibre Channel port director must be completed.
- Ensure that the HBA WWNs (initiators) appear on the list of initiators that are logged into the array.
- If the number of volumes that will be published to nodes is high, then configure the maximum number of LUNs for your HBAs on each node. See the appropriate HBA document to configure the maximum number of LUNs.

### iSCSI Requirements

The following requirements must be fulfilled in order to successfully use the iSCSI protocol with the CSI PowerMax driver.

- All Kubernetes nodes must have the _iscsi-initiator-utils_ package installed. On Debian based distributions the package name is  _open-iscsi_.
- The _iscsid_ service must be enabled and running. You can enable the service by running the following command on all worker nodes: `systemctl enable --now iscsid`
- To configure iSCSI in Red Hat OpenShift clusters, you can create a `MachineConfig` object using the console or `oc` to ensure that the iSCSI daemon starts on all the Red Hat CoreOS nodes. Here is an example of a `MachineConfig` object:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  name: 99-iscsid
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
    systemd:
      units:
      - name: "iscsid.service"
        enabled: true
```

Once the `MachineConfig` object has been deployed, CoreOS will ensure that the `iscsid.service` starts automatically. You can check the status of the iSCSI service by entering the following command on each worker node in the cluster: `sudo systemctl status iscsid`.

- Ensure that the iSCSI initiators are available on all the nodes where the driver node plugin will be installed.
- Ensure that the unique initiator name is set in _/etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi_.
- If your worker nodes are running Red Hat CoreOS, make sure that automatic iSCSI login at boot is configured. Please contact RedHat for more details.
- Kubernetes nodes must have network connectivity to an iSCSI director on the Dell PowerMax array that has IP interfaces. Manually create IP routes for each node that connects to the Dell PowerMax if required.
- Ensure that the iSCSI initiators on the nodes are not a part of any existing Host (Initiator Group) on the Dell PowerMax array.
- The CSI Driver needs the port group name containing the required iSCSI director ports. These port groups must be set up on each Dell PowerMax array. All the port group names supplied to the driver must exist on each Dell PowerMax with the same name.

Refer to the [Dell Host Connectivity Guide](https://elabnavigator.dell.com/vault/pdf/Linux.pdf) for more information.

### NVMe Requirements

The following requirements must be fulfilled in order to successfully use the NVMe/TCP protocols with the CSI PowerMax driver:

- Modules including the nvme, nvme_core, nvme_fabrics, and nvme_tcp are required for using NVMe over Fabrics using TCP. Load the NVMe and NVMe-OF Modules using the below commands:
```bash
modprobe nvme
modprobe nvme_tcp
```
- The NVMe modules may not be available after a node reboot. Loading the modules at startup is recommended.

> Starting with OCP 4.14 NVMe/TCP is enabled by default on RCOS nodes.


**Cluster requirements**

- All OpenShift or Kubernetes nodes connecting to Dell storage arrays must use unique host NQNs.
- The driver requires the NVMe command-line interface (nvme-cli) to manage the NVMe clients and targets. The NVMe CLI tool is installed in the host using the following command on RPM oriented Linux distributions.

```bash
sudo dnf -y install nvme-cli
```

- Support for NVMe requires native NVMe multipathing to be configured on each worker node in the cluster. Please refer to the [Dell Host Connectivity Guide](https://elabnavigator.dell.com/vault/pdf/Linux.pdf) for more details on NVMe multipathing requirements. To determine if the worker nodes are configured for native NVMe multipathing run the following command on each worker node:

```bash
cat /sys/module/nvme_core/parameters/multipath
```

 >If the result of the command displays Y then NVMe native multipathing is enabled in the kernel. If the output is N then native NVMe multipating is disabled. Consult the [Dell Host Connectivity Guide](https://elabnavigator.dell.com/vault/pdf/Linux.pdf) for Linux to enable native NVMe multipathing.

**Configure the IO policy**

- The default NVMeTCP native multipathing policy is "numa". The preferred IO policy for NVMe devices used for PowerMax is round-robin. You can use udev rules to enable the round robin policy on all worker nodes. To view the IO policy you can use the following command:

```bash
nvme list-subsys
```

To change the IO policy to round-robin you can add a udev rule on each worker node. Place a config file in /etc/udev/rules.d with the name 71-nvme-io-policy.rules with the following contents:

```text
ACTION=="add|change", SUBSYSTEM=="nvme-subsystem", ATTR{iopolicy}="round-robin"
```

In order to change the rules on a running kernel you can run the following commands:

```bash
/sbin/udevadm control --reload-rules
/sbin/udevadm trigger --type=devices --action=change
```

On OCP clusters you can add a MachineConfig to enable this rule on all worker nodes:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  name: 99-workers-multipath-round-robin
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
    storage:
      files:
      - contents:
          source: data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,QUNUSU9OPT0iYWRkfGNoYW5nZSIsIFNVQlNZU1RFTT09Im52bWUtc3Vic3lzdGVtIiwgQVRUUntpb3BvbGljeX09InJvdW5kLXJvYmluIg==
          verification: {}
        filesystem: root
        mode: 420
        path: /etc/udev/rules.d/71-nvme-io-policy.rules
```

**Array requirements**

Once the NVMe endpoint is created on the array, follow the following steps to update the endpoint name to adhere to the CSI driver requirements.

   - Run  ```nvme discover --transport=tcp --traddr=<InterfaceAdd> --trsvcid=4420```. <InterfaceAdd> is the placeholder for actual IP address of NVMe Endpoint.
   - Fetch the _subnqn_, for e.g.,  _nqn.1988-11.com.dell:PowerMax_2500:00:000120001100_, this will be used as the subnqn holder while updating NVMe endpoint name.
   - Update the NVMe endpoint name as ```<subnqn>:<dir><port>>```. Here is an example how it should look, _nqn.1988-11.com.dell:PowerMax_2500:00:000120001100:OR1C000_

### NFS Requirements

CSI Driver for Dell PowerMax supports NFS communication. Ensure that the following requirements are met before you install CSI Driver:
- Configure the NFS network. Please refer [here](https://dl.dell.com/content/manual57826791-dell-powermax-file-protocol-guide.pdf?language=en-us&ps=true) for more details.
- PowerMax Embedded Management guest to access Unisphere for PowerMax.
- Create the NAS server. Please refer [here](https://dl.dell.com/content/manual55638050-dell-powermax-file-quick-start-guide.pdf?language=en-us&ps=true) for more details.

### Linux Multipathing Requirements

Dell PowerMax supports Linux multipathing (DM-MPIO) and NVMe native multipathing. Configure Linux multipathing before installing the CSI Driver.

> For NVMe connectivity native NVMe multipathing is used. The following sections apply only for iSCSI and Fiber Channel connectivity.

Configure Linux multipathing as follows:
- Ensure that all nodes have the _Device Mapper Multipathing_ package installed.
  You can install it by running `dnf install device-mapper-multipath` or `apt install multipath-tools` based on your Linux distribution.
- Ensure that the multipath command `mpathconf` is available on all Kubernetes nodes.
- Enable multipathing using the `mpathconf --enable --with_multipathd y` command.  A default configuration file, `/etc/multipath.conf` is created.
- Enable `user_friendly_names` and `find_multipaths` in the `multipath.conf` file.
- As a best practice, use these options to help the operating system and the mulitpathing software detect path changes efficiently:

```text
path_grouping_policy multibus
path_checker tur
features "1 queue_if_no_path"
path_selector "round-robin 0"
no_path_retry 10
```

The following is a sample multipath.conf file. You may have to adjust these values based on your environment.

```text
defaults {
  user_friendly_names yes
  find_multipaths yes
  path_grouping_policy multibus
  path_checker tur
  features "1 queue_if_no_path"
  path_selector "round-robin 0"
  no_path_retry 10
}
  blacklist {
}
```

On some distributions the multipathd service for changes to the configuration and dynamically reconfigures itself. If you need to manually trigger a reload you can run the following command:
`sudo systemctl reload multipathd`

To enable multipathd on RedHat CoreOS nodes you need to prepare a working configuration encoded in base64. For example you can run the following command to encode the above multipath.config file.

```text
echo 'defaults {
  user_friendly_names yes
  find_multipaths yes
  path_grouping_policy multibus
  path_checker tur
  features "1 queue_if_no_path"
  path_selector "round-robin 0"
  no_path_retry 10
}
  blacklist {
}' | base64 -w0
```

The output of the above command follows:
```text
ZGVmYXVsdHMgewogIHVzZXJfZnJpZW5kbHlfbmFtZXMgeWVzCiAgZmluZF9tdWx0aXBhdGhzIHllcwogIHBhdGhfZ3JvdXBpbmdfcG9saWN5IG11bHRpYnVzCiAgcGF0aF9jaGVja2VyIHR1cgogIGZlYXR1cmVzICIxIHF1ZXVlX2lmX25vX3BhdGgiCiAgcGF0aF9zZWxlY3RvciAicm91bmQtcm9iaW4gMCIKICBub19wYXRoX3JldHJ5IDEwCn0KICBibGFja2xpc3Qgewp9Cg==
```

Use the base64 encoded string output in the following `MachineConfig` yaml file (under source section)

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  name: workers-multipath-conf-default
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
    storage:
      files:
      - contents:
          source: data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,ZGVmYXVsdHMgewogIHVzZXJfZnJpZW5kbHlfbmFtZXMgeWVzCiAgZmluZF9tdWx0aXBhdGhzIHllcwogIHBhdGhfZ3JvdXBpbmdfcG9saWN5IG11bHRpYnVzCiAgcGF0aF9jaGVja2VyIHR1cgogIGZlYXR1cmVzICIxIHF1ZXVlX2lmX25vX3BhdGgiCiAgcGF0aF9zZWxlY3RvciAicm91bmQtcm9iaW4gMCIKICBub19wYXRoX3JldHJ5IDEwCn0KICBibGFja2xpc3Qgewp9Cg==
          verification: {}
        filesystem: root
        mode: 400
        path: /etc/multipath.conf
```

After deploying this`MachineConfig` object, CoreOS will start the multipath service automatically.
Alternatively, you can check the status of the multipath service by running the following command on each worker node.
`sudo multipath -ll`

Refer to the [Dell Host Connectivity Guide](https://elabnavigator.dell.com/vault/pdf/Linux.pdf) for more information.

### PowerPath for Linux requirements

The CSI Driver for Dell PowerMax supports PowerPath for Linux. Configure Linux PowerPath before installing the CSI Driver.

Follow this procedure to set up PowerPath for Linux:

- All the nodes must have the PowerPath package installed . Download the PowerPath archive for the environment from [Dell Online Support](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-in/product-support/product/powerpath-for-linux/drivers).
- `Untar` the PowerPath archive, Copy the RPM package into a temporary folder and Install PowerPath using `rpm -ivh DellEMCPower.LINUX-<version>-<build>.<platform>.x86_64.rpm`
- Start the PowerPath service using `systemctl start PowerPath`

>Note: Do not install Dell PowerPath if multi-path software is already installed, as they cannot co-exist with native multi-path software.

### Auto RDM for vSphere over FC requirements

The CSI Driver for Dell PowerMax supports auto RDM for vSphere over FC. These requirements are applicable for the clusters deployed on ESX/ESXi using virtualized environment.

Set up the environment as follows:

- Requires VMware vCenter management software to manage all ESX/ESXis where the cluster is hosted.

- Add all FC array ports zoned to the ESX/ESXis to a port group where the cluster is hosted .

- Add initiators from all ESX/ESXis to a host(initiator group)/host group(cascaded initiator group) where the cluster is hosted.
- Create a secret which contains vCenter privileges. Follow the steps [here](#support-for-auto-rdm-for-vsphere-over-fc) to create the same.

## Installation

### Create secret for client-side TLS verification (Optional)
Create a secret named powermax-certs in the namespace where the CSI PowerMax driver will be installed. This is an optional step and is only required if you are setting the env variable X_CSI_POWERMAX_SKIP_CERTIFICATE_VALIDATION to false. See the detailed documentation on how to create this secret [here](../../../helm/drivers/installation/powermax#certificate-validation-for-unisphere-rest-api-calls).

### Install Driver

1. Create namespace:
   Run `kubectl create namespace <driver-namespace>` using the desired name to create the namespace.
2. Create PowerMax credentials:
   Create a file called powermax-creds.yaml with the following content:
     ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        metadata:
          name: powermax-creds
            # Replace driver-namespace with the namespace where driver is being deployed
          namespace: <driver-namespace>
        type: Opaque
        data:
          # set username to the base64 encoded username
          username: <base64 username>
          # set password to the base64 encoded password
          password: <base64 password>
          # Uncomment the following key if you wish to use ISCSI CHAP authentication (v1.3.0 onwards)
          # chapsecret: <base64 CHAP secret>
     ```
   Replace the values for the username and password parameters. These values can be obtained using base64 encoding as described in the following example:
   ```BASH
   echo -n "myusername" | base64
   echo -n "mypassword" | base64
   # If mychapsecret is the iSCSI CHAP secret
   echo -n "mychapsecret" | base64

   ```
   Run the `kubectl create -f powermax-creds.yaml` command to create the secret.
3. Create a configmap using sample [here](https://github.com/dell/csm-operator/tree/master/samples/csireverseproxy). Fill in the appropriate values for driver configuration.
   Example: config.yaml
   ```yaml
   mode: StandAlone # Mode for the reverseproxy, should not be changed
   port: 2222 # Port on which reverseproxy will listen
   logLevel: debug
   logFormat: text
   standAloneConfig:
     storageArrays:
        - storageArrayId: "000000000001" # arrayID
          primaryURL: https://primary-1.unisphe.re:8443 # primary unisphere for arrayID
          backupURL: https://backup-1.unisphe.re:8443   # backup unisphere for arrayID
          proxyCredentialSecrets:
            - proxy-secret-11 # credential secret for primary unisphere, e.g., powermax-creds
            - proxy-secret-12 # credential secret for backup unisphere, e.g., powermax-creds
        - storageArrayId: "000000000002"
          primaryURL: https://primary-2.unisphe.re:8443
          backupURL: https://backup-2.unisphe.re:8443
          proxyCredentialSecrets:
           - proxy-secret-21
           - proxy-secret-22
     managementServers:
       - url: https://primary-1.unisphe.re:8443 # primary unisphere endpoint
         arrayCredentialSecret: primary-1-secret # primary credential secret e.g., powermax-creds
         skipCertificateValidation: true
       - url: https://backup-1.unisphe.re:8443 # backup unisphere endpoint
         arrayCredentialSecret: backup-1-secret # backup credential secret e.g., powermax-creds
         skipCertificateValidation: false # value false, to verify unisphere certificate and provide certSecret
         certSecret: primary-certs # unisphere verification certificate
       - url: https://primary-2.unisphe.re:8443
         arrayCredentialSecret: primary-2-secret
         skipCertificateValidation: true
       - url: https://backup-2.unisphe.re:8443
         arrayCredentialSecret: backup-2-secret
         skipCertificateValidation: false
         certSecret: primary-certs
   ```
   After editing the file, run this command to create a secret called `powermax-reverseproxy-config`. If you are using a different namespace/secret name, just substitute those into the command.
    ```bash
    kubectl create configmap powermax-reverseproxy-config --from-file config.yaml -n powermax
    ```
4. Create a configmap using below sample file. Fill in the appropriate values for driver configuration. Example: X_CSI_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL:"ISCSI"
   ```yaml

      kind: ConfigMap
      metadata:
        name: powermax-array-config
        namespace: powermax
      data:
        powermax-array-config.yaml: |
          X_CSI_POWERMAX_PORTGROUPS: "" # Portgroup is required in case of iSCSI only
          X_CSI_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL: "" # Defaults to empty
          X_CSI_POWERMAX_ENDPOINT: "https://10.0.0.0:8443"
          X_CSI_MANAGED_ARRAYS: "000000000000,000000000000,"
   ```

5. Create a CR (Custom Resource) for PowerMax using the sample files provided

    a. Install the PowerMax driver using default configuration using
    the sample file provided
   [here](https://github.com/dell/csm-operator/tree/main/samples/minimal-samples). This file can be modified to use custom parameters if needed.

    b. Install the PowerMax driver using the detailed configuration using the sample file provided
    [here](https://github.com/dell/csm-operator/tree/main/samples).

> NOTE:
> [Replication module](https://github.com/dell/csm-operator/blob/main/samples/storage_csm_powermax_v2130.yaml#L283) must be enabled to use the Metro volume

Example:
```yaml
    - name: replication
      enabled: true
```
>  [Target clusterID](https://github.com/dell/csm-operator/blob/main/samples/storage_csm_powermax_v2130.yaml#L316) should be set as self

Example:
```yaml
    - name: "TARGET_CLUSTERS_IDS"
      value: "self"
```

6. Users should configure the parameters in CR. The following table lists the primary configurable parameters of the PowerMax driver and their default values:

   | Parameter | Description | Required | Default |
   |-----------|-------------|----------|---------|
   | namespace | Specifies namespace where the driver will be installed | Yes | "powermax" |
   | dnsPolicy | Determines the DNS Policy of the Node service | Yes | ClusterFirstWithHostNet |
   | replicas  | Controls the number of controller Pods you deploy. If controller Pods are greater than the number of available nodes, excess Pods will become stuck in pending. The default is 2 which allows for Controller high availability.                                          | Yes      | 2                              |
   | fsGroupPolicy                                   | Defines which FS Group policy mode to be used, Supported modes `None, File and ReadWriteOnceWithFSType`. In OCP <= 4.16 and K8s <= 1.29, fsGroupPolicy is an immutable field.                                                                                                                                                                  | No       | "ReadWriteOnceWithFSType"      |

## Other features to enable
### Dynamic Logging Configuration

This feature is introduced in CSI Driver for powermax version 2.0.0.

As part of driver installation, a ConfigMap with the name `powermax-config-params` is created using the manifest located in the sample file. This ConfigMap contains an attribute `CSI_LOG_LEVEL` which specifies the current log level of the CSI driver. To set the default/initial log level user can set this field during driver installation.

To update the log level dynamically user has to edit the ConfigMap `powermax-config-params` and update `CSI_LOG_LEVEL` to the desired log level.
```bash
kubectl edit configmap -n powermax powermax-config-params
```

### Volume Health Monitoring
This feature is introduced in CSI Driver for PowerMax version 2.2.0.

Volume Health Monitoring feature is optional and by default this feature is disabled for drivers when installed via CSM operator.

To enable this feature, set  `X_CSI_HEALTH_MONITOR_ENABLED` to `true` in the driver manifest under controller and node section. Also, install the `external-health-monitor` from `sideCars` section for controller plugin.
To get the volume health state `value` under controller should be set to true as seen below. To get the volume stats `value` under node should be set to true.
```yaml
     # Install the 'external-health-monitor' sidecar accordingly.
        # Allowed values:
        #   true: enable checking of health condition of CSI volumes
        #   false: disable checking of health condition of CSI volumes
        # Default value: false
     controller:
       envs:
         - name: X_CSI_HEALTH_MONITOR_ENABLED
           value: "true"
     node:
       envs:
        # X_CSI_HEALTH_MONITOR_ENABLED: Enable/Disable health monitor of CSI volumes from node plugin - volume usage
        # Allowed values:
        #   true: enable checking of health condition of CSI volumes
        #   false: disable checking of health condition of CSI volumes
        # Default value: false
         - name: X_CSI_HEALTH_MONITOR_ENABLED
           value: "true"
```

### Support for custom topology keys

This feature is introduced in CSI Driver for PowerMax version 2.3.0.

Support for custom topology keys is optional and by default this feature is disabled for drivers when installed via CSM operator.

X_CSI_TOPOLOGY_CONTROL_ENABLED provides a way to filter topology keys on a node based on array and transport protocol. If enabled, user can create custom topology keys by editing node-topology-config configmap.

1. To enable this feature, set  `X_CSI_TOPOLOGY_CONTROL_ENABLED` to `true` in the driver manifest under node section.

   ```yaml
      # X_CSI_TOPOLOGY_CONTROL_ENABLED provides a way to filter topology keys on a node based on array and transport protocol
           # if enabled, user can create custom topology keys by editing node-topology-config configmap.
           # Allowed values:
           #   true: enable the filtration based on config map
           #   false: disable the filtration based on config map
           # Default value: false
           - name: X_CSI_TOPOLOGY_CONTROL_ENABLED
             value: "false"
   ```
2. Edit the sample config map "node-topology-config" as described [here](https://github.com/dell/csi-powermax/blob/main/samples/configmap/topologyConfig.yaml) with appropriate values:
   Example:
   ```yaml
           kind: ConfigMap
           metadata:
             name: node-topology-config
             namespace: powermax
           data:
             topologyConfig.yaml: |
               allowedConnections:
                 - nodeName: "node1"
                   rules:
                     - "000000000001:FC"
                     - "000000000002:FC"
                 - nodeName: "*"
                   rules:
                     - "000000000002:FC"
               deniedConnections:
                 - nodeName: "node2"
                   rules:
                     - "000000000002:*"
                 - nodeName: "node3"
                   rules:
                     - "*:*"

     ```
   | Parameter | Description  |
   |-----------|--------------|
   | allowedConnections | List of node, array and protocol info for user allowed configuration |
   | allowedConnections.nodeName | Name of the node on which user wants to apply given rules |
   | allowedConnections.rules | List of StorageArrayID:TransportProtocol pair |
   | deniedConnections | List of node, array and protocol info for user denied configuration |
   | deniedConnections.nodeName | Name of the node on which user wants to apply given rules  |
   | deniedConnections.rules | List of StorageArrayID:TransportProtocol pair |
<br>

3. Run following command to create the configmap
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f topologyConfig.yaml
  ```
 >Note: Name of the configmap should always be `node-topology-config`.

             value: "false"
           # X_CSI_VSPHERE_PORTGROUP: An existing portGroup that driver will use for vSphere
           # recommended format: csi-x-VC-PG, x can be anything of user choice
           # Allowed value: valid existing port group on the array
           # Default value: "" <empty>
           - name: "X_CSI_VSPHERE_PORTGROUP"
             value: ""
           # X_CSI_VSPHERE_HOSTNAME: An existing host(initiator group)/ host group(cascaded initiator group) that driver will use for vSphere
           # this host/host group should contain initiators from all the ESXs/ESXi host where the cluster is deployed
           # recommended format: csi-x-VC-HN, x can be anything of user choice
           # Allowed value: valid existing host(initiator group)/ host group(cascaded initiator group) on the array
           # Default value: "" <empty>
           - name: "X_CSI_VSPHERE_HOSTNAME"
             value: ""
   ```
2. Edit the `Secret` file vcenter-creds [here](https://github.com/dell/csi-powermax/blob/main/samples/secret/vcenter-secret.yaml) with required values.
Example:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: vcenter-creds
     # Set driver namespace
     namespace: powermax
   type: Opaque
   data:
     # set username to the base64 encoded username
     username: YWRtaW4=
     # set password to the base64 encoded password
     password: YWRtaW4=
   ```
These values can be obtained using base64 encoding as described in the following example:
```bash
echo -n "myusername" | base64
echo -n "mypassword" | base64
```
where *myusername* and *mypassword* are credentials for a user with vCenter privileges.
3.
4. Run following command to create the configmap
  ```bash
  kubectl create -f vcenter-secret.yaml
  ```
>Note: Name of the secret should always be `vcenter-creds`.
