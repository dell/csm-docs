      <description>This section covers CSM for Resiliency&amp;rsquo;s design. The detail is sufficient that you should be able to understand what CSM for Resiliency is designed to do in various situations and how it works. CSM for Resiliency is deployed as a sidecar named podmon with a CSI driver in both the controller pods and node pods. These are referred to as controller-podmon and node-podmon respectively.
Generally controller-podmon and the driver controller pods are deployed using a Deployment.</description>

      <description>CSM for Resiliency is primarily designed to detect pod failures due to some kind of node failure or node communication failure. The diagram below shows the hardware environment that is assumed in the design.
A Kubernetes Control Plane is assumed to exist that provides the K8S API service used by CSM for Resiliency. There is an arbitrary number of worker nodes (two are shown in the diagram) that are connected to the Control Plane through a K8S Control Plane IP Network.</description>
