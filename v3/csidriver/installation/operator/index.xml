      <description>Migration Steps Save the CR yaml file of the current CSI driver to preserve the settings. Use the following commands in your cluster to get the CR: kubectl -n &amp;lt;namespace&amp;gt; get &amp;lt;CRD_kind&amp;gt; kubectl -n &amp;lt;namespace&amp;gt; get &amp;lt;CRD_kind&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;CR_name&amp;gt; -o yaml Example for CSI Unity:
kubectl -n openshift-operators get CSIUnity kubectl -n openshift-operators get CSIUnity/test-unity -o yaml Map and update the settings from the CR in step 1 to the relevant CSM Operator CR As the yaml content may differ, ensure the values held in the step 1 CR backup are present in the new CR before installing the new driver.</description>
